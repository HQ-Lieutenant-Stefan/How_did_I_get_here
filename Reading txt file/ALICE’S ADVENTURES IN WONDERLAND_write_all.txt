   89: alice
   90: was
   91: beginning
   92: to
   93: get
   94: very
   95: tired
   96: of
   97: sitting
   98: by
   99: her
  100: sister
  101: on
  102: the
  103: bank
  104: and
  105: of
  106: having
  107: nothing
  108: to
  109: do
  110: once
  111: or
  112: twice
  113: she
  114: had
  115: peeped
  116: into
  117: the
  118: book
  119: her
  120: sister
  121: was
  122: reading
  123: but
  124: it
  125: had
  126: no
  127: pictures
  128: or
  129: conversations
  130: in
  131: it
  132: and
  133: what
  134: is
  135: the
  136: use
  137: of
  138: a
  139: book
  140: thought
  141: alice
  142: without
  143: pictures
  144: or
  145: conversations
  146: so
  147: she
  148: was
  149: considering
  150: in
  151: her
  152: own
  153: mind
  154: as
  155: well
  156: as
  157: she
  158: could
  159: for
  160: the
  161: hot
  162: day
  163: made
  164: her
  165: feel
  166: very
  167: sleepy
  168: and
  169: stupid
  170: whether
  171: the
  172: pleasure
  173: of
  174: making
  175: a
  176: daisy-chain
  177: would
  178: be
  179: worth
  180: the
  181: trouble
  182: of
  183: getting
  184: up
  185: and
  186: picking
  187: the
  188: daisies
  189: when
  190: suddenly
  191: a
  192: white
  193: rabbit
  194: with
  195: pink
  196: eyes
  197: ran
  198: close
  199: by
  200: her
  201: there
  202: was
  203: nothing
  204: so
  205: very
  206: remarkable
  207: in
  208: that
  209: nor
  210: did
  211: alice
  212: think
  213: it
  214: so
  215: very
  216: much
  217: out
  218: of
  219: the
  220: way
  221: to
  222: hear
  223: the
  224: rabbit
  225: say
  226: to
  227: itself
  228: oh
  229: dear
  230: oh
  231: dear
  232: i
  233: shall
  234: be
  235: late
  236: when
  237: she
  238: thought
  239: it
  240: over
  241: afterwards
  242: it
  243: occurred
  244: to
  245: her
  246: that
  247: she
  248: ought
  249: to
  250: have
  251: wondered
  252: at
  253: this
  254: but
  255: at
  256: the
  257: time
  258: it
  259: all
  260: seemed
  261: quite
  262: natural
  263: but
  264: when
  265: the
  266: rabbit
  267: actually
  268: took
  269: a
  270: watch
  271: out
  272: of
  273: its
  274: waistcoat-pocket
  275: and
  276: looked
  277: at
  278: it
  279: and
  280: then
  281: hurried
  282: on
  283: alice
  284: started
  285: to
  286: her
  287: feet
  288: for
  289: it
  290: flashed
  291: across
  292: her
  293: mind
  294: that
  295: she
  296: had
  297: never
  298: before
  299: seen
  300: a
  301: rabbit
  302: with
  303: either
  304: a
  305: waistcoat-pocket
  306: or
  307: a
  308: watch
  309: to
  310: take
  311: out
  312: of
  313: it
  314: and
  315: burning
  316: with
  317: curiosity
  318: she
  319: ran
  320: across
  321: the
  322: field
  323: after
  324: it
  325: and
  326: fortunately
  327: was
  328: just
  329: in
  330: time
  331: to
  332: see
  333: it
  334: pop
  335: down
  336: a
  337: large
  338: rabbit-hole
  339: under
  340: the
  341: hedge
  342: in
  343: another
  344: moment
  345: down
  346: went
  347: alice
  348: after
  349: it
  350: never
  351: once
  352: considering
  353: how
  354: in
  355: the
  356: world
  357: she
  358: was
  359: to
  360: get
  361: out
  362: again
  363: the
  364: rabbit-hole
  365: went
  366: straight
  367: on
  368: like
  369: a
  370: tunnel
  371: for
  372: some
  373: way
  374: and
  375: then
  376: dipped
  377: suddenly
  378: down
  379: so
  380: suddenly
  381: that
  382: alice
  383: had
  384: not
  385: a
  386: moment
  387: to
  388: think
  389: about
  390: stopping
  391: herself
  392: before
  393: she
  394: found
  395: herself
  396: falling
  397: down
  398: a
  399: very
  400: deep
  401: well
  402: either
  403: the
  404: well
  405: was
  406: very
  407: deep
  408: or
  409: she
  410: fell
  411: very
  412: slowly
  413: for
  414: she
  415: had
  416: plenty
  417: of
  418: time
  419: as
  420: she
  421: went
  422: down
  423: to
  424: look
  425: about
  426: her
  427: and
  428: to
  429: wonder
  430: what
  431: was
  432: going
  433: to
  434: happen
  435: next
  436: first
  437: she
  438: tried
  439: to
  440: look
  441: down
  442: and
  443: make
  444: out
  445: what
  446: she
  447: was
  448: coming
  449: to
  450: but
  451: it
  452: was
  453: too
  454: dark
  455: to
  456: see
  457: anything
  458: then
  459: she
  460: looked
  461: at
  462: the
  463: sides
  464: of
  465: the
  466: well
  467: and
  468: noticed
  469: that
  470: they
  471: were
  472: filled
  473: with
  474: cupboards
  475: and
  476: book-shelves
  477: here
  478: and
  479: there
  480: she
  481: saw
  482: maps
  483: and
  484: pictures
  485: hung
  486: upon
  487: pegs
  488: she
  489: took
  490: down
  491: a
  492: jar
  493: from
  494: one
  495: of
  496: the
  497: shelves
  498: as
  499: she
  500: passed
  501: it
  502: was
  503: labelled
  504: orange
  505: marmalade
  506: but
  507: to
  508: her
  509: great
  510: disappointment
  511: it
  512: was
  513: empty
  514: she
  515: did
  516: not
  517: like
  518: to
  519: drop
  520: the
  521: jar
  522: for
  523: fear
  524: of
  525: killing
  526: somebody
  527: underneath
  528: so
  529: managed
  530: to
  531: put
  532: it
  533: into
  534: one
  535: of
  536: the
  537: cupboards
  538: as
  539: she
  540: fell
  541: past
  542: it
  543: well
  544: thought
  545: alice
  546: to
  547: herself
  548: after
  549: such
  550: a
  551: fall
  552: as
  553: this
  554: i
  555: shall
  556: think
  557: nothing
  558: of
  559: tumbling
  560: down
  561: stairs
  562: how
  563: brave
  564: they’ll
  565: all
  566: think
  567: me
  568: at
  569: home
  570: why
  571: i
  572: wouldn’t
  573: say
  574: anything
  575: about
  576: it
  577: even
  578: if
  579: i
  580: fell
  581: off
  582: the
  583: top
  584: of
  585: the
  586: house
  587: which
  588: was
  589: very
  590: likely
  591: true
  592: down
  593: down
  594: down
  595: would
  596: the
  597: fall
  598: never
  599: come
  600: to
  601: an
  602: end
  603: i
  604: wonder
  605: how
  606: many
  607: miles
  608: i’ve
  609: fallen
  610: by
  611: this
  612: time
  613: she
  614: said
  615: aloud
  616: i
  617: must
  618: be
  619: getting
  620: somewhere
  621: near
  622: the
  623: centre
  624: of
  625: the
  626: earth
  627: let
  628: me
  629: see
  630: that
  631: would
  632: be
  633: four
  634: thousand
  635: miles
  636: down
  637: i
  638: think
  639: for
  640: you
  641: see
  642: alice
  643: had
  644: learnt
  645: several
  646: things
  647: of
  648: this
  649: sort
  650: in
  651: her
  652: lessons
  653: in
  654: the
  655: schoolroom
  656: and
  657: though
  658: this
  659: was
  660: not
  661: a
  662: very
  663: good
  664: opportunity
  665: for
  666: showing
  667: off
  668: her
  669: knowledge
  670: as
  671: there
  672: was
  673: no
  674: one
  675: to
  676: listen
  677: to
  678: her
  679: still
  680: it
  681: was
  682: good
  683: practice
  684: to
  685: say
  686: it
  687: over
  688: yes
  689: that’s
  690: about
  691: the
  692: right
  693: distance—but
  694: then
  695: i
  696: wonder
  697: what
  698: latitude
  699: or
  700: longitude
  701: i’ve
  702: got
  703: to
  704: alice
  705: had
  706: no
  707: idea
  708: what
  709: latitude
  710: was
  711: or
  712: longitude
  713: either
  714: but
  715: thought
  716: they
  717: were
  718: nice
  719: grand
  720: words
  721: to
  722: say
  723: presently
  724: she
  725: began
  726: again
  727: i
  728: wonder
  729: if
  730: i
  731: shall
  732: fall
  733: right
  734: through
  735: the
  736: earth
  737: how
  738: funny
  739: it’ll
  740: seem
  741: to
  742: come
  743: out
  744: among
  745: the
  746: people
  747: that
  748: walk
  749: with
  750: their
  751: heads
  752: downward
  753: the
  754: antipathies
  755: i
  756: think
  757: she
  758: was
  759: rather
  760: glad
  761: there
  762: was
  763: no
  764: one
  765: listening
  766: this
  767: time
  768: as
  769: it
  770: didn’t
  771: sound
  772: at
  773: all
  774: the
  775: right
  776: word
  777: but
  778: i
  779: shall
  780: have
  781: to
  782: ask
  783: them
  784: what
  785: the
  786: name
  787: of
  788: the
  789: country
  790: is
  791: you
  792: know
  793: please
  794: ma’am
  795: is
  796: this
  797: new
  798: zealand
  799: or
  800: australia
  801: and
  802: she
  803: tried
  804: to
  805: curtsey
  806: as
  807: she
  808: spoke—fancy
  809: curtseying
  810: as
  811: you’re
  812: falling
  813: through
  814: the
  815: air
  816: do
  817: you
  818: think
  819: you
  820: could
  821: manage
  822: it
  823: and
  824: what
  825: an
  826: ignorant
  827: little
  828: girl
  829: she’ll
  830: think
  831: me
  832: for
  833: asking
  834: no
  835: it’ll
  836: never
  837: do
  838: to
  839: ask
  840: perhaps
  841: i
  842: shall
  843: see
  844: it
  845: written
  846: up
  847: somewhere
  848: down
  849: down
  850: down
  851: there
  852: was
  853: nothing
  854: else
  855: to
  856: do
  857: so
  858: alice
  859: soon
  860: began
  861: talking
  862: again
  863: dinah’ll
  864: miss
  865: me
  866: very
  867: much
  868: to-night
  869: i
  870: should
  871: think
  872: dinah
  873: was
  874: the
  875: cat
  876: i
  877: hope
  878: they’ll
  879: remember
  880: her
  881: saucer
  882: of
  883: milk
  884: at
  885: tea-time
  886: dinah
  887: my
  888: dear
  889: i
  890: wish
  891: you
  892: were
  893: down
  894: here
  895: with
  896: me
  897: there
  898: are
  899: no
  900: mice
  901: in
  902: the
  903: air
  904: i’m
  905: afraid
  906: but
  907: you
  908: might
  909: catch
  910: a
  911: bat
  912: and
  913: that’s
  914: very
  915: like
  916: a
  917: mouse
  918: you
  919: know
  920: but
  921: do
  922: cats
  923: eat
  924: bats
  925: i
  926: wonder
  927: and
  928: here
  929: alice
  930: began
  931: to
  932: get
  933: rather
  934: sleepy
  935: and
  936: went
  937: on
  938: saying
  939: to
  940: herself
  941: in
  942: a
  943: dreamy
  944: sort
  945: of
  946: way
  947: do
  948: cats
  949: eat
  950: bats
  951: do
  952: cats
  953: eat
  954: bats
  955: and
  956: sometimes
  957: do
  958: bats
  959: eat
  960: cats
  961: for
  962: you
  963: see
  964: as
  965: she
  966: couldn’t
  967: answer
  968: either
  969: question
  970: it
  971: didn’t
  972: much
  973: matter
  974: which
  975: way
  976: she
  977: put
  978: it
  979: she
  980: felt
  981: that
  982: she
  983: was
  984: dozing
  985: off
  986: and
  987: had
  988: just
  989: begun
  990: to
  991: dream
  992: that
  993: she
  994: was
  995: walking
  996: hand
  997: in
  998: hand
  999: with
 1000: dinah
 1001: and
 1002: saying
 1003: to
 1004: her
 1005: very
 1006: earnestly
 1007: now
 1008: dinah
 1009: tell
 1010: me
 1011: the
 1012: truth
 1013: did
 1014: you
 1015: ever
 1016: eat
 1017: a
 1018: bat
 1019: when
 1020: suddenly
 1021: thump
 1022: thump
 1023: down
 1024: she
 1025: came
 1026: upon
 1027: a
 1028: heap
 1029: of
 1030: sticks
 1031: and
 1032: dry
 1033: leaves
 1034: and
 1035: the
 1036: fall
 1037: was
 1038: over
 1039: alice
 1040: was
 1041: not
 1042: a
 1043: bit
 1044: hurt
 1045: and
 1046: she
 1047: jumped
 1048: up
 1049: on
 1050: to
 1051: her
 1052: feet
 1053: in
 1054: a
 1055: moment
 1056: she
 1057: looked
 1058: up
 1059: but
 1060: it
 1061: was
 1062: all
 1063: dark
 1064: overhead
 1065: before
 1066: her
 1067: was
 1068: another
 1069: long
 1070: passage
 1071: and
 1072: the
 1073: white
 1074: rabbit
 1075: was
 1076: still
 1077: in
 1078: sight
 1079: hurrying
 1080: down
 1081: it
 1082: there
 1083: was
 1084: not
 1085: a
 1086: moment
 1087: to
 1088: be
 1089: lost
 1090: away
 1091: went
 1092: alice
 1093: like
 1094: the
 1095: wind
 1096: and
 1097: was
 1098: just
 1099: in
 1100: time
 1101: to
 1102: hear
 1103: it
 1104: say
 1105: as
 1106: it
 1107: turned
 1108: a
 1109: corner
 1110: oh
 1111: my
 1112: ears
 1113: and
 1114: whiskers
 1115: how
 1116: late
 1117: it’s
 1118: getting
 1119: she
 1120: was
 1121: close
 1122: behind
 1123: it
 1124: when
 1125: she
 1126: turned
 1127: the
 1128: corner
 1129: but
 1130: the
 1131: rabbit
 1132: was
 1133: no
 1134: longer
 1135: to
 1136: be
 1137: seen
 1138: she
 1139: found
 1140: herself
 1141: in
 1142: a
 1143: long
 1144: low
 1145: hall
 1146: which
 1147: was
 1148: lit
 1149: up
 1150: by
 1151: a
 1152: row
 1153: of
 1154: lamps
 1155: hanging
 1156: from
 1157: the
 1158: roof
 1159: there
 1160: were
 1161: doors
 1162: all
 1163: round
 1164: the
 1165: hall
 1166: but
 1167: they
 1168: were
 1169: all
 1170: locked
 1171: and
 1172: when
 1173: alice
 1174: had
 1175: been
 1176: all
 1177: the
 1178: way
 1179: down
 1180: one
 1181: side
 1182: and
 1183: up
 1184: the
 1185: other
 1186: trying
 1187: every
 1188: door
 1189: she
 1190: walked
 1191: sadly
 1192: down
 1193: the
 1194: middle
 1195: wondering
 1196: how
 1197: she
 1198: was
 1199: ever
 1200: to
 1201: get
 1202: out
 1203: again
 1204: suddenly
 1205: she
 1206: came
 1207: upon
 1208: a
 1209: little
 1210: three-legged
 1211: table
 1212: all
 1213: made
 1214: of
 1215: solid
 1216: glass
 1217: there
 1218: was
 1219: nothing
 1220: on
 1221: it
 1222: except
 1223: a
 1224: tiny
 1225: golden
 1226: key
 1227: and
 1228: alice’s
 1229: first
 1230: thought
 1231: was
 1232: that
 1233: it
 1234: might
 1235: belong
 1236: to
 1237: one
 1238: of
 1239: the
 1240: doors
 1241: of
 1242: the
 1243: hall
 1244: but
 1245: alas
 1246: either
 1247: the
 1248: locks
 1249: were
 1250: too
 1251: large
 1252: or
 1253: the
 1254: key
 1255: was
 1256: too
 1257: small
 1258: but
 1259: at
 1260: any
 1261: rate
 1262: it
 1263: would
 1264: not
 1265: open
 1266: any
 1267: of
 1268: them
 1269: however
 1270: on
 1271: the
 1272: second
 1273: time
 1274: round
 1275: she
 1276: came
 1277: upon
 1278: a
 1279: low
 1280: curtain
 1281: she
 1282: had
 1283: not
 1284: noticed
 1285: before
 1286: and
 1287: behind
 1288: it
 1289: was
 1290: a
 1291: little
 1292: door
 1293: about
 1294: fifteen
 1295: inches
 1296: high
 1297: she
 1298: tried
 1299: the
 1300: little
 1301: golden
 1302: key
 1303: in
 1304: the
 1305: lock
 1306: and
 1307: to
 1308: her
 1309: great
 1310: delight
 1311: it
 1312: fitted
 1313: alice
 1314: opened
 1315: the
 1316: door
 1317: and
 1318: found
 1319: that
 1320: it
 1321: led
 1322: into
 1323: a
 1324: small
 1325: passage
 1326: not
 1327: much
 1328: larger
 1329: than
 1330: a
 1331: rat-hole
 1332: she
 1333: knelt
 1334: down
 1335: and
 1336: looked
 1337: along
 1338: the
 1339: passage
 1340: into
 1341: the
 1342: loveliest
 1343: garden
 1344: you
 1345: ever
 1346: saw
 1347: how
 1348: she
 1349: longed
 1350: to
 1351: get
 1352: out
 1353: of
 1354: that
 1355: dark
 1356: hall
 1357: and
 1358: wander
 1359: about
 1360: among
 1361: those
 1362: beds
 1363: of
 1364: bright
 1365: flowers
 1366: and
 1367: those
 1368: cool
 1369: fountains
 1370: but
 1371: she
 1372: could
 1373: not
 1374: even
 1375: get
 1376: her
 1377: head
 1378: through
 1379: the
 1380: doorway
 1381: and
 1382: even
 1383: if
 1384: my
 1385: head
 1386: would
 1387: go
 1388: through
 1389: thought
 1390: poor
 1391: alice
 1392: it
 1393: would
 1394: be
 1395: of
 1396: very
 1397: little
 1398: use
 1399: without
 1400: my
 1401: shoulders
 1402: oh
 1403: how
 1404: i
 1405: wish
 1406: i
 1407: could
 1408: shut
 1409: up
 1410: like
 1411: a
 1412: telescope
 1413: i
 1414: think
 1415: i
 1416: could
 1417: if
 1418: i
 1419: only
 1420: knew
 1421: how
 1422: to
 1423: begin
 1424: for
 1425: you
 1426: see
 1427: so
 1428: many
 1429: out-of-the-way
 1430: things
 1431: had
 1432: happened
 1433: lately
 1434: that
 1435: alice
 1436: had
 1437: begun
 1438: to
 1439: think
 1440: that
 1441: very
 1442: few
 1443: things
 1444: indeed
 1445: were
 1446: really
 1447: impossible
 1448: there
 1449: seemed
 1450: to
 1451: be
 1452: no
 1453: use
 1454: in
 1455: waiting
 1456: by
 1457: the
 1458: little
 1459: door
 1460: so
 1461: she
 1462: went
 1463: back
 1464: to
 1465: the
 1466: table
 1467: half
 1468: hoping
 1469: she
 1470: might
 1471: find
 1472: another
 1473: key
 1474: on
 1475: it
 1476: or
 1477: at
 1478: any
 1479: rate
 1480: a
 1481: book
 1482: of
 1483: rules
 1484: for
 1485: shutting
 1486: people
 1487: up
 1488: like
 1489: telescopes
 1490: this
 1491: time
 1492: she
 1493: found
 1494: a
 1495: little
 1496: bottle
 1497: on
 1498: it
 1499: which
 1500: certainly
 1501: was
 1502: not
 1503: here
 1504: before
 1505: said
 1506: alice
 1507: and
 1508: round
 1509: the
 1510: neck
 1511: of
 1512: the
 1513: bottle
 1514: was
 1515: a
 1516: paper
 1517: label
 1518: with
 1519: the
 1520: words
 1521: drink
 1522: me
 1523: beautifully
 1524: printed
 1525: on
 1526: it
 1527: in
 1528: large
 1529: letters
 1530: it
 1531: was
 1532: all
 1533: very
 1534: well
 1535: to
 1536: say
 1537: drink
 1538: me
 1539: but
 1540: the
 1541: wise
 1542: little
 1543: alice
 1544: was
 1545: not
 1546: going
 1547: to
 1548: do
 1549: that
 1550: in
 1551: a
 1552: hurry
 1553: no
 1554: i’ll
 1555: look
 1556: first
 1557: she
 1558: said
 1559: and
 1560: see
 1561: whether
 1562: it’s
 1563: marked
 1564: poison
 1565: or
 1566: not
 1567: for
 1568: she
 1569: had
 1570: read
 1571: several
 1572: nice
 1573: little
 1574: histories
 1575: about
 1576: children
 1577: who
 1578: had
 1579: got
 1580: burnt
 1581: and
 1582: eaten
 1583: up
 1584: by
 1585: wild
 1586: beasts
 1587: and
 1588: other
 1589: unpleasant
 1590: things
 1591: all
 1592: because
 1593: they
 1594: would
 1595: not
 1596: remember
 1597: the
 1598: simple
 1599: rules
 1600: their
 1601: friends
 1602: had
 1603: taught
 1604: them
 1605: such
 1606: as
 1607: that
 1608: a
 1609: red-hot
 1610: poker
 1611: will
 1612: burn
 1613: you
 1614: if
 1615: you
 1616: hold
 1617: it
 1618: too
 1619: long
 1620: and
 1621: that
 1622: if
 1623: you
 1624: cut
 1625: your
 1626: finger
 1627: very
 1628: deeply
 1629: with
 1630: a
 1631: knife
 1632: it
 1633: usually
 1634: bleeds
 1635: and
 1636: she
 1637: had
 1638: never
 1639: forgotten
 1640: that
 1641: if
 1642: you
 1643: drink
 1644: much
 1645: from
 1646: a
 1647: bottle
 1648: marked
 1649: poison
 1650: it
 1651: is
 1652: almost
 1653: certain
 1654: to
 1655: disagree
 1656: with
 1657: you
 1658: sooner
 1659: or
 1660: later
 1661: however
 1662: this
 1663: bottle
 1664: was
 1665: not
 1666: marked
 1667: poison
 1668: so
 1669: alice
 1670: ventured
 1671: to
 1672: taste
 1673: it
 1674: and
 1675: finding
 1676: it
 1677: very
 1678: nice
 1679: it
 1680: had
 1681: in
 1682: fact
 1683: a
 1684: sort
 1685: of
 1686: mixed
 1687: flavour
 1688: of
 1689: cherry-tart
 1690: custard
 1691: pine-apple
 1692: roast
 1693: turkey
 1694: toffee
 1695: and
 1696: hot
 1697: buttered
 1698: toast
 1699: she
 1700: very
 1701: soon
 1702: finished
 1703: it
 1704: off

 1725: what
 1726: a
 1727: curious
 1728: feeling
 1729: said
 1730: alice
 1731: i
 1732: must
 1733: be
 1734: shutting
 1735: up
 1736: like
 1737: a
 1738: telescope
 1739: and
 1740: so
 1741: it
 1742: was
 1743: indeed
 1744: she
 1745: was
 1746: now
 1747: only
 1748: ten
 1749: inches
 1750: high
 1751: and
 1752: her
 1753: face
 1754: brightened
 1755: up
 1756: at
 1757: the
 1758: thought
 1759: that
 1760: she
 1761: was
 1762: now
 1763: the
 1764: right
 1765: size
 1766: for
 1767: going
 1768: through
 1769: the
 1770: little
 1771: door
 1772: into
 1773: that
 1774: lovely
 1775: garden
 1776: first
 1777: however
 1778: she
 1779: waited
 1780: for
 1781: a
 1782: few
 1783: minutes
 1784: to
 1785: see
 1786: if
 1787: she
 1788: was
 1789: going
 1790: to
 1791: shrink
 1792: any
 1793: further
 1794: she
 1795: felt
 1796: a
 1797: little
 1798: nervous
 1799: about
 1800: this
 1801: for
 1802: it
 1803: might
 1804: end
 1805: you
 1806: know
 1807: said
 1808: alice
 1809: to
 1810: herself
 1811: in
 1812: my
 1813: going
 1814: out
 1815: altogether
 1816: like
 1817: a
 1818: candle
 1819: i
 1820: wonder
 1821: what
 1822: i
 1823: should
 1824: be
 1825: like
 1826: then
 1827: and
 1828: she
 1829: tried
 1830: to
 1831: fancy
 1832: what
 1833: the
 1834: flame
 1835: of
 1836: a
 1837: candle
 1838: is
 1839: like
 1840: after
 1841: the
 1842: candle
 1843: is
 1844: blown
 1845: out
 1846: for
 1847: she
 1848: could
 1849: not
 1850: remember
 1851: ever
 1852: having
 1853: seen
 1854: such
 1855: a
 1856: thing
 1857: after
 1858: a
 1859: while
 1860: finding
 1861: that
 1862: nothing
 1863: more
 1864: happened
 1865: she
 1866: decided
 1867: on
 1868: going
 1869: into
 1870: the
 1871: garden
 1872: at
 1873: once
 1874: but
 1875: alas
 1876: for
 1877: poor
 1878: alice
 1879: when
 1880: she
 1881: got
 1882: to
 1883: the
 1884: door
 1885: she
 1886: found
 1887: she
 1888: had
 1889: forgotten
 1890: the
 1891: little
 1892: golden
 1893: key
 1894: and
 1895: when
 1896: she
 1897: went
 1898: back
 1899: to
 1900: the
 1901: table
 1902: for
 1903: it
 1904: she
 1905: found
 1906: she
 1907: could
 1908: not
 1909: possibly
 1910: reach
 1911: it
 1912: she
 1913: could
 1914: see
 1915: it
 1916: quite
 1917: plainly
 1918: through
 1919: the
 1920: glass
 1921: and
 1922: she
 1923: tried
 1924: her
 1925: best
 1926: to
 1927: climb
 1928: up
 1929: one
 1930: of
 1931: the
 1932: legs
 1933: of
 1934: the
 1935: table
 1936: but
 1937: it
 1938: was
 1939: too
 1940: slippery
 1941: and
 1942: when
 1943: she
 1944: had
 1945: tired
 1946: herself
 1947: out
 1948: with
 1949: trying
 1950: the
 1951: poor
 1952: little
 1953: thing
 1954: sat
 1955: down
 1956: and
 1957: cried
 1958: come
 1959: there’s
 1960: no
 1961: use
 1962: in
 1963: crying
 1964: like
 1965: that
 1966: said
 1967: alice
 1968: to
 1969: herself
 1970: rather
 1971: sharply
 1972: i
 1973: advise
 1974: you
 1975: to
 1976: leave
 1977: off
 1978: this
 1979: minute
 1980: she
 1981: generally
 1982: gave
 1983: herself
 1984: very
 1985: good
 1986: advice
 1987: though
 1988: she
 1989: very
 1990: seldom
 1991: followed
 1992: it
 1993: and
 1994: sometimes
 1995: she
 1996: scolded
 1997: herself
 1998: so
 1999: severely
 2000: as
 2001: to
 2002: bring
 2003: tears
 2004: into
 2005: her
 2006: eyes
 2007: and
 2008: once
 2009: she
 2010: remembered
 2011: trying
 2012: to
 2013: box
 2014: her
 2015: own
 2016: ears
 2017: for
 2018: having
 2019: cheated
 2020: herself
 2021: in
 2022: a
 2023: game
 2024: of
 2025: croquet
 2026: she
 2027: was
 2028: playing
 2029: against
 2030: herself
 2031: for
 2032: this
 2033: curious
 2034: child
 2035: was
 2036: very
 2037: fond
 2038: of
 2039: pretending
 2040: to
 2041: be
 2042: two
 2043: people
 2044: but
 2045: it’s
 2046: no
 2047: use
 2048: now
 2049: thought
 2050: poor
 2051: alice
 2052: to
 2053: pretend
 2054: to
 2055: be
 2056: two
 2057: people
 2058: why
 2059: there’s
 2060: hardly
 2061: enough
 2062: of
 2063: me
 2064: left
 2065: to
 2066: make
 2067: one
 2068: respectable
 2069: person
 2070: soon
 2071: her
 2072: eye
 2073: fell
 2074: on
 2075: a
 2076: little
 2077: glass
 2078: box
 2079: that
 2080: was
 2081: lying
 2082: under
 2083: the
 2084: table
 2085: she
 2086: opened
 2087: it
 2088: and
 2089: found
 2090: in
 2091: it
 2092: a
 2093: very
 2094: small
 2095: cake
 2096: on
 2097: which
 2098: the
 2099: words
 2100: eat
 2101: me
 2102: were
 2103: beautifully
 2104: marked
 2105: in
 2106: currants
 2107: well
 2108: i’ll
 2109: eat
 2110: it
 2111: said
 2112: alice
 2113: and
 2114: if
 2115: it
 2116: makes
 2117: me
 2118: grow
 2119: larger
 2120: i
 2121: can
 2122: reach
 2123: the
 2124: key
 2125: and
 2126: if
 2127: it
 2128: makes
 2129: me
 2130: grow
 2131: smaller
 2132: i
 2133: can
 2134: creep
 2135: under
 2136: the
 2137: door
 2138: so
 2139: either
 2140: way
 2141: i’ll
 2142: get
 2143: into
 2144: the
 2145: garden
 2146: and
 2147: i
 2148: don’t
 2149: care
 2150: which
 2151: happens
 2152: she
 2153: ate
 2154: a
 2155: little
 2156: bit
 2157: and
 2158: said
 2159: anxiously
 2160: to
 2161: herself
 2162: which
 2163: way
 2164: which
 2165: way
 2166: holding
 2167: her
 2168: hand
 2169: on
 2170: the
 2171: top
 2172: of
 2173: her
 2174: head
 2175: to
 2176: feel
 2177: which
 2178: way
 2179: it
 2180: was
 2181: growing
 2182: and
 2183: she
 2184: was
 2185: quite
 2186: surprised
 2187: to
 2188: find
 2189: that
 2190: she
 2191: remained
 2192: the
 2193: same
 2194: size
 2195: to
 2196: be
 2197: sure
 2198: this
 2199: generally
 2200: happens
 2201: when
 2202: one
 2203: eats
 2204: cake
 2205: but
 2206: alice
 2207: had
 2208: got
 2209: so
 2210: much
 2211: into
 2212: the
 2213: way
 2214: of
 2215: expecting
 2216: nothing
 2217: but
 2218: out-of-the-way
 2219: things
 2220: to
 2221: happen
 2222: that
 2223: it
 2224: seemed
 2225: quite
 2226: dull
 2227: and
 2228: stupid
 2229: for
 2230: life
 2231: to
 2232: go
 2233: on
 2234: in
 2235: the
 2236: common
 2237: way
 2238: so
 2239: she
 2240: set
 2241: to
 2242: work
 2243: and
 2244: very
 2245: soon
 2246: finished

 2295: speak
 2296: good

 2298: now
 2299: i’m

 2308: was
 2309: good-bye

 2318: feet
 2319: they
 2320: seemed
 2321: to
 2322: be
 2323: almost
 2324: out
 2325: of
 2326: sight
 2327: they
 2328: were
 2329: getting
 2330: so
 2331: far
 2332: off
 2333: oh
 2334: my
 2335: poor
 2336: little
 2337: feet
 2338: i
 2339: wonder

 2342: put
 2343: on
 2344: your
 2345: shoes
 2346: and

 2358: i
 2359: shall

 2362: great
 2363: deal
 2364: too
 2365: far
 2366: off
 2367: to
 2368: trouble
 2369: myself
 2370: about
 2371: you
 2372: you
 2373: must
 2374: manage
 2375: the

 2381: must
 2382: be
 2383: kind
 2384: to
 2385: them
 2386: thought
 2387: alice
 2388: or
 2389: perhaps
 2390: they
 2391: won’t
 2392: walk

 2421: would

 2426: go
 2427: by
 2428: the
 2429: carrier
 2430: she
 2431: thought
 2432: and
 2433: how
 2434: funny
 2435: it’ll
 2436: seem
 2437: sending

 2439: to
 2440: one’s
 2441: own
 2442: feet
 2443: and
 2444: how
 2445: odd
 2446: the
 2447: directions
 2448: will
 2449: look
 2450: alice’s
 2451: right
 2452: foot
 2453: esq
 2454: hearthrug
 2455: near
 2456: the
 2457: fender
 2458: with
 2459: alice’s
 2460: love
 2461: oh
 2462: dear
 2463: what
 2464: nonsense
 2465: i’m
 2466: talking
 2467: just
 2468: then
 2469: her
 2470: head
 2471: struck
 2472: against
 2473: the
 2474: roof
 2475: of
 2476: the
 2477: hall
 2478: in
 2479: fact
 2480: she
 2481: was
 2482: now
 2483: more
 2484: than
 2485: nine
 2486: feet
 2487: high
 2488: and
 2489: she
 2490: at
 2491: once
 2492: took
 2493: up
 2494: the
 2495: little
 2496: golden
 2497: key
 2498: and
 2499: hurried
 2500: off
 2501: to
 2502: the
 2503: garden
 2504: door
 2505: poor
 2506: alice
 2507: it
 2508: was
 2509: as
 2510: much
 2511: as
 2512: she
 2513: could
 2514: do
 2515: lying
 2516: down
 2517: on
 2518: one
 2519: side
 2520: to
 2521: look
 2522: through
 2523: into
 2524: the
 2525: garden
 2526: with
 2527: one
 2528: eye
 2529: but
 2530: to
 2531: get
 2532: through
 2533: was
 2534: more
 2535: hopeless
 2536: than
 2537: ever
 2538: she
 2539: sat
 2540: down
 2541: and
 2542: began
 2543: to
 2544: cry
 2545: again
 2546: you
 2547: ought
 2548: to
 2549: be
 2550: ashamed
 2551: of
 2552: yourself
 2553: said
 2554: alice
 2555: a
 2556: great
 2557: girl
 2558: like
 2559: you
 2560: she
 2561: might
 2562: well
 2563: say
 2564: this
 2565: to
 2566: go
 2567: on
 2568: crying
 2569: in
 2570: this
 2571: way
 2572: stop
 2573: this
 2574: moment
 2575: i
 2576: tell
 2577: you
 2578: but
 2579: she
 2580: went
 2581: on
 2582: all
 2583: the
 2584: same
 2585: shedding
 2586: gallons
 2587: of
 2588: tears
 2589: until
 2590: there
 2591: was
 2592: a
 2593: large
 2594: pool
 2595: all
 2596: round
 2597: her
 2598: about
 2599: four
 2600: inches
 2601: deep
 2602: and
 2603: reaching
 2604: half
 2605: down
 2606: the
 2607: hall
 2608: after
 2609: a
 2610: time
 2611: she
 2612: heard
 2613: a
 2614: little
 2615: pattering
 2616: of
 2617: feet
 2618: in
 2619: the
 2620: distance
 2621: and
 2622: she
 2623: hastily
 2624: dried
 2625: her
 2626: eyes
 2627: to
 2628: see
 2629: what
 2630: was
 2631: coming
 2632: it
 2633: was
 2634: the
 2635: white
 2636: rabbit
 2637: returning
 2638: splendidly
 2639: dressed
 2640: with
 2641: a
 2642: pair
 2643: of
 2644: white
 2645: kid
 2646: gloves
 2647: in
 2648: one
 2649: hand
 2650: and
 2651: a
 2652: large
 2653: fan
 2654: in
 2655: the
 2656: other
 2657: he
 2658: came
 2659: trotting
 2660: along
 2661: in
 2662: a
 2663: great
 2664: hurry
 2665: muttering
 2666: to
 2667: himself
 2668: as
 2669: he
 2670: came
 2671: oh
 2672: the
 2673: duchess
 2674: the
 2675: duchess
 2676: oh
 2677: won’t
 2678: she
 2679: be
 2680: savage
 2681: if
 2682: i’ve
 2683: kept
 2684: her
 2685: waiting
 2686: alice
 2687: felt
 2688: so
 2689: desperate
 2690: that
 2691: she
 2692: was
 2693: ready
 2694: to
 2695: ask
 2696: help
 2697: of
 2698: any
 2699: one
 2700: so
 2701: when
 2702: the
 2703: rabbit
 2704: came
 2705: near
 2706: her
 2707: she
 2708: began
 2709: in
 2710: a
 2711: low
 2712: timid
 2713: voice
 2714: if
 2715: you
 2716: please
 2717: sir
 2718: the
 2719: rabbit
 2720: started
 2721: violently
 2722: dropped
 2723: the
 2724: white
 2725: kid
 2726: gloves
 2727: and
 2728: the
 2729: fan
 2730: and
 2731: skurried
 2732: away
 2733: into
 2734: the
 2735: darkness
 2736: as
 2737: hard
 2738: as
 2739: he
 2740: could
 2741: go
 2742: alice
 2743: took
 2744: up
 2745: the
 2746: fan
 2747: and
 2748: gloves
 2749: and
 2750: as
 2751: the
 2752: hall
 2753: was
 2754: very
 2755: hot
 2756: she
 2757: kept
 2758: fanning
 2759: herself
 2760: all
 2761: the
 2762: time
 2763: she
 2764: went
 2765: on
 2766: talking
 2767: dear
 2768: dear
 2769: how
 2770: queer
 2771: everything
 2772: is
 2773: to-day
 2774: and
 2775: yesterday
 2776: things
 2777: went
 2778: on
 2779: just
 2780: as
 2781: usual
 2782: i
 2783: wonder
 2784: if
 2785: i’ve
 2786: been
 2787: changed
 2788: in
 2789: the
 2790: night
 2791: let
 2792: me
 2793: think
 2794: was
 2795: i
 2796: the
 2797: same
 2798: when
 2799: i
 2800: got
 2801: up
 2802: this
 2803: morning
 2804: i
 2805: almost
 2806: think
 2807: i
 2808: can
 2809: remember
 2810: feeling
 2811: a
 2812: little
 2813: different
 2814: but
 2815: if
 2816: i’m
 2817: not
 2818: the
 2819: same
 2820: the
 2821: next
 2822: question
 2823: is
 2824: who
 2825: in
 2826: the
 2827: world
 2828: am
 2829: i
 2830: ah
 2831: that’s
 2832: the
 2833: great
 2834: puzzle
 2835: and
 2836: she
 2837: began
 2838: thinking
 2839: over
 2840: all
 2841: the
 2842: children
 2843: she
 2844: knew
 2845: that
 2846: were
 2847: of
 2848: the
 2849: same
 2850: age
 2851: as
 2852: herself
 2853: to
 2854: see
 2855: if
 2856: she
 2857: could
 2858: have
 2859: been
 2860: changed
 2861: for
 2862: any
 2863: of
 2864: them
 2865: i’m
 2866: sure
 2867: i’m
 2868: not
 2869: ada
 2870: she
 2871: said
 2872: for
 2873: her
 2874: hair
 2875: goes
 2876: in
 2877: such
 2878: long
 2879: ringlets
 2880: and
 2881: mine
 2882: doesn’t
 2883: go
 2884: in
 2885: ringlets
 2886: at
 2887: all
 2888: and
 2889: i’m
 2890: sure
 2891: i
 2892: can’t
 2893: be
 2894: mabel
 2895: for
 2896: i
 2897: know
 2898: all
 2899: sorts
 2900: of
 2901: things
 2902: and
 2903: she
 2904: oh
 2905: she
 2906: knows
 2907: such
 2908: a
 2909: very
 2910: little
 2911: besides
 2912: she’s
 2913: she
 2914: and
 2915: i’m
 2916: i
 2917: and—oh

 2920: puzzling
 2921: it
 2922: all
 2923: is
 2924: i’ll
 2925: try
 2926: if
 2927: i
 2928: know
 2929: all
 2930: the
 2931: things
 2932: i
 2933: used
 2934: to
 2935: know

 2959: get
 2960: to
 2961: twenty
 2962: at
 2963: that
 2964: rate
 2965: however
 2966: the
 2967: multiplication
 2968: table
 2969: doesn’t
 2970: signify

 3010: she
 3011: crossed
 3012: her
 3013: hands
 3014: on
 3015: her
 3016: lap
 3017: as
 3018: if
 3019: she
 3020: were
 3021: saying
 3022: lessons
 3023: and
 3024: began
 3025: to
 3026: repeat
 3027: it
 3028: but
 3029: her
 3030: voice
 3031: sounded
 3032: hoarse
 3033: and
 3034: strange
 3035: and
 3036: the
 3037: words
 3038: did

 3247: down
 3248: at
 3249: her
 3250: hands
 3251: and
 3252: was
 3253: surprised
 3254: to
 3255: see
 3256: that
 3257: she
 3258: had
 3259: put
 3260: on
 3261: one
 3262: of
 3263: the
 3264: rabbit’s
 3265: little
 3266: white
 3267: kid
 3268: gloves
 3269: while
 3270: she
 3271: was
 3272: talking
 3273: how
 3274: can
 3275: i
 3276: have
 3277: done
 3278: that
 3279: she
 3280: thought
 3281: i
 3282: must
 3283: be
 3284: growing
 3285: small
 3286: again
 3287: she
 3288: got
 3289: up
 3290: and
 3291: went
 3292: to
 3293: the
 3294: table
 3295: to
 3296: measure
 3297: herself
 3298: by
 3299: it
 3300: and
 3301: found
 3302: that
 3303: as
 3304: nearly
 3305: as
 3306: she
 3307: could
 3308: guess
 3309: she
 3310: was
 3311: now
 3312: about
 3313: two
 3314: feet
 3315: high
 3316: and
 3317: was
 3318: going
 3319: on
 3320: shrinking
 3321: rapidly
 3322: she
 3323: soon
 3324: found
 3325: out
 3326: that
 3327: the
 3328: cause
 3329: of
 3330: this
 3331: was
 3332: the
 3333: fan
 3334: she
 3335: was
 3336: holding
 3337: and
 3338: she
 3339: dropped
 3340: it
 3341: hastily
 3342: just
 3343: in
 3344: time
 3345: to
 3346: avoid
 3347: shrinking
 3348: away
 3349: altogether
 3350: that
 3351: was
 3352: a
 3353: narrow
 3354: escape
 3355: said
 3356: alice
 3357: a
 3358: good
 3359: deal
 3360: frightened
 3361: at
 3362: the
 3363: sudden
 3364: change
 3365: but
 3366: very
 3367: glad
 3368: to
 3369: find
 3370: herself
 3371: still
 3372: in
 3373: existence
 3374: and
 3375: now
 3376: for
 3377: the
 3378: garden
 3379: and
 3380: she
 3381: ran
 3382: with
 3383: all
 3384: speed
 3385: back
 3386: to
 3387: the
 3388: little
 3389: door
 3390: but
 3391: alas
 3392: the
 3393: little
 3394: door
 3395: was
 3396: shut
 3397: again
 3398: and
 3399: the
 3400: little
 3401: golden
 3402: key
 3403: was
 3404: lying
 3405: on
 3406: the
 3407: glass
 3408: table
 3409: as
 3410: before
 3411: and
 3412: things
 3413: are
 3414: worse
 3415: than
 3416: ever
 3417: thought
 3418: the
 3419: poor
 3420: child
 3421: for
 3422: i
 3423: never
 3424: was
 3425: so
 3426: small
 3427: as
 3428: this
 3429: before
 3430: never
 3431: and
 3432: i
 3433: declare
 3434: it’s
 3435: too
 3436: bad
 3437: that
 3438: it
 3439: is
 3440: as
 3441: she
 3442: said
 3443: these
 3444: words
 3445: her
 3446: foot
 3447: slipped
 3448: and
 3449: in
 3450: another
 3451: moment
 3452: splash
 3453: she
 3454: was
 3455: up
 3456: to
 3457: her
 3458: chin
 3459: in
 3460: salt
 3461: water
 3462: her
 3463: first
 3464: idea
 3465: was
 3466: that
 3467: she
 3468: had
 3469: somehow
 3470: fallen
 3471: into
 3472: the
 3473: sea
 3474: and
 3475: in
 3476: that
 3477: case
 3478: i
 3479: can
 3480: go
 3481: back
 3482: by
 3483: railway
 3484: she
 3485: said
 3486: to
 3487: herself
 3488: alice
 3489: had
 3490: been
 3491: to
 3492: the
 3493: seaside
 3494: once
 3495: in
 3496: her
 3497: life
 3498: and
 3499: had
 3500: come
 3501: to
 3502: the
 3503: general
 3504: conclusion
 3505: that
 3506: wherever
 3507: you
 3508: go
 3509: to
 3510: on
 3511: the
 3512: english
 3513: coast
 3514: you
 3515: find
 3516: a
 3517: number
 3518: of
 3519: bathing
 3520: machines
 3521: in
 3522: the
 3523: sea
 3524: some
 3525: children
 3526: digging
 3527: in
 3528: the
 3529: sand
 3530: with
 3531: wooden
 3532: spades
 3533: then
 3534: a
 3535: row
 3536: of
 3537: lodging
 3538: houses
 3539: and
 3540: behind
 3541: them
 3542: a
 3543: railway
 3544: station
 3545: however
 3546: she
 3547: soon
 3548: made
 3549: out
 3550: that
 3551: she
 3552: was
 3553: in
 3554: the
 3555: pool
 3556: of
 3557: tears
 3558: which
 3559: she
 3560: had
 3561: wept
 3562: when
 3563: she
 3564: was
 3565: nine
 3566: feet
 3567: high
 3568: i
 3569: wish
 3570: i
 3571: hadn’t
 3572: cried
 3573: so
 3574: much
 3575: said
 3576: alice
 3577: as
 3578: she
 3579: swam
 3580: about
 3581: trying
 3582: to
 3583: find
 3584: her
 3585: way
 3586: out
 3587: i
 3588: shall
 3589: be
 3590: punished
 3591: for
 3592: it
 3593: now
 3594: i
 3595: suppose
 3596: by
 3597: being
 3598: drowned
 3599: in
 3600: my
 3601: own
 3602: tears
 3603: that
 3604: will
 3605: be
 3606: a
 3607: queer
 3608: thing
 3609: to
 3610: be
 3611: sure
 3612: however
 3613: everything
 3614: is
 3615: queer
 3616: to-day
 3617: just
 3618: then
 3619: she
 3620: heard
 3621: something
 3622: splashing
 3623: about
 3624: in
 3625: the
 3626: pool
 3627: a
 3628: little
 3629: way
 3630: off
 3631: and
 3632: she
 3633: swam
 3634: nearer
 3635: to
 3636: make
 3637: out
 3638: what
 3639: it
 3640: was
 3641: at
 3642: first
 3643: she
 3644: thought
 3645: it
 3646: must
 3647: be
 3648: a
 3649: walrus
 3650: or
 3651: hippopotamus
 3652: but
 3653: then
 3654: she
 3655: remembered
 3656: how
 3657: small
 3658: she
 3659: was
 3660: now
 3661: and
 3662: she
 3663: soon
 3664: made
 3665: out
 3666: that
 3667: it
 3668: was
 3669: only
 3670: a
 3671: mouse
 3672: that
 3673: had
 3674: slipped
 3675: in
 3676: like
 3677: herself
 3678: would
 3679: it
 3680: be
 3681: of
 3682: any
 3683: use
 3684: now
 3685: thought
 3686: alice
 3687: to
 3688: speak
 3689: to
 3690: this
 3691: mouse
 3692: everything
 3693: is
 3694: so
 3695: out-of-the-way
 3696: down
 3697: here
 3698: that
 3699: i
 3700: should
 3701: think
 3702: very
 3703: likely
 3704: it
 3705: can
 3706: talk
 3707: at
 3708: any
 3709: rate
 3710: there’s
 3711: no
 3712: harm
 3713: in
 3714: trying
 3715: so
 3716: she
 3717: began
 3718: o
 3719: mouse
 3720: do
 3721: you
 3722: know
 3723: the
 3724: way
 3725: out
 3726: of
 3727: this
 3728: pool
 3729: i
 3730: am
 3731: very
 3732: tired
 3733: of
 3734: swimming
 3735: about
 3736: here
 3737: o
 3738: mouse
 3739: alice
 3740: thought
 3741: this
 3742: must
 3743: be
 3744: the
 3745: right
 3746: way
 3747: of
 3748: speaking
 3749: to
 3750: a
 3751: mouse
 3752: she
 3753: had
 3754: never
 3755: done
 3756: such
 3757: a
 3758: thing
 3759: before
 3760: but
 3761: she
 3762: remembered
 3763: having
 3764: seen
 3765: in
 3766: her
 3767: brother’s
 3768: latin
 3769: grammar
 3770: a
 3771: mouse—of
 3772: a
 3773: mouse—to
 3774: a
 3775: mouse—a
 3776: mouse—o
 3777: mouse
 3778: the
 3779: mouse
 3780: looked
 3781: at
 3782: her
 3783: rather
 3784: inquisitively
 3785: and
 3786: seemed
 3787: to
 3788: her
 3789: to
 3790: wink
 3791: with
 3792: one
 3793: of
 3794: its
 3795: little
 3796: eyes
 3797: but
 3798: it
 3799: said
 3800: nothing
 3801: perhaps
 3802: it
 3803: doesn’t
 3804: understand
 3805: english
 3806: thought
 3807: alice
 3808: i
 3809: daresay
 3810: it’s
 3811: a
 3812: french
 3813: mouse
 3814: come
 3815: over
 3816: with
 3817: william
 3818: the
 3819: conqueror
 3820: for
 3821: with
 3822: all
 3823: her
 3824: knowledge
 3825: of
 3826: history
 3827: alice
 3828: had
 3829: no
 3830: very
 3831: clear
 3832: notion
 3833: how
 3834: long
 3835: ago
 3836: anything
 3837: had
 3838: happened
 3839: so
 3840: she
 3841: began
 3842: again
 3843: où
 3844: est
 3845: ma
 3846: chatte
 3847: which
 3848: was
 3849: the
 3850: first
 3851: sentence
 3852: in
 3853: her
 3854: french
 3855: lesson-book
 3856: the
 3857: mouse
 3858: gave
 3859: a
 3860: sudden
 3861: leap
 3862: out
 3863: of
 3864: the
 3865: water
 3866: and
 3867: seemed
 3868: to
 3869: quiver
 3870: all
 3871: over
 3872: with
 3873: fright
 3874: oh
 3875: i
 3876: beg
 3877: your
 3878: pardon
 3879: cried
 3880: alice
 3881: hastily
 3882: afraid
 3883: that
 3884: she
 3885: had
 3886: hurt
 3887: the
 3888: poor
 3889: animal’s
 3890: feelings
 3891: i
 3892: quite
 3893: forgot
 3894: you
 3895: didn’t
 3896: like
 3897: cats
 3898: not
 3899: like
 3900: cats
 3901: cried
 3902: the
 3903: mouse
 3904: in
 3905: a
 3906: shrill
 3907: passionate
 3908: voice
 3909: would
 3910: you
 3911: like
 3912: cats
 3913: if
 3914: you
 3915: were
 3916: me
 3917: well
 3918: perhaps
 3919: not
 3920: said
 3921: alice
 3922: in
 3923: a
 3924: soothing
 3925: tone
 3926: don’t
 3927: be
 3928: angry
 3929: about
 3930: it
 3931: and
 3932: yet
 3933: i
 3934: wish
 3935: i
 3936: could
 3937: show
 3938: you
 3939: our
 3940: cat
 3941: dinah
 3942: i
 3943: think
 3944: you’d
 3945: take
 3946: a
 3947: fancy
 3948: to
 3949: cats
 3950: if
 3951: you
 3952: could
 3953: only
 3954: see
 3955: her
 3956: she
 3957: is
 3958: such
 3959: a
 3960: dear
 3961: quiet
 3962: thing
 3963: alice
 3964: went
 3965: on
 3966: half
 3967: to
 3968: herself
 3969: as
 3970: she
 3971: swam
 3972: lazily
 3973: about
 3974: in
 3975: the
 3976: pool
 3977: and
 3978: she
 3979: sits
 3980: purring
 3981: so
 3982: nicely
 3983: by
 3984: the
 3985: fire
 3986: licking
 3987: her
 3988: paws
 3989: and
 3990: washing
 3991: her
 3992: face—and
 3993: she
 3994: is
 3995: such
 3996: a
 3997: nice
 3998: soft
 3999: thing
 4000: to
 4001: nurse—and
 4002: she’s
 4003: such
 4004: a
 4005: capital
 4006: one
 4007: for
 4008: catching
 4009: mice—oh
 4010: i
 4011: beg
 4012: your
 4013: pardon
 4014: cried
 4015: alice
 4016: again
 4017: for
 4018: this
 4019: time
 4020: the
 4021: mouse
 4022: was
 4023: bristling
 4024: all
 4025: over
 4026: and
 4027: she
 4028: felt
 4029: certain
 4030: it
 4031: must
 4032: be
 4033: really
 4034: offended
 4035: we
 4036: won’t
 4037: talk
 4038: about
 4039: her
 4040: any
 4041: more
 4042: if
 4043: you’d
 4044: rather
 4045: not
 4046: we
 4047: indeed
 4048: cried
 4049: the
 4050: mouse
 4051: who
 4052: was
 4053: trembling
 4054: down
 4055: to
 4056: the
 4057: end

 4092: a
 4093: great
 4094: hurry
 4095: to

 4114: on
 4115: eagerly
 4116: there
 4117: is
 4118: such
 4119: a
 4120: nice
 4121: little
 4122: dog
 4123: near
 4124: our
 4125: house
 4126: i
 4127: should
 4128: like
 4129: to

 4131: you
 4132: a
 4133: little
 4134: bright-eyed
 4135: terrier
 4136: you
 4137: know
 4138: with
 4139: oh
 4140: such
 4141: long
 4142: curly
 4143: brown
 4144: hair
 4145: and
 4146: it’ll
 4147: fetch
 4148: things
 4149: when
 4150: you
 4151: throw
 4152: them
 4153: and
 4154: it’ll
 4155: sit
 4156: up
 4157: and
 4158: beg
 4159: for
 4160: its
 4161: dinner
 4162: and
 4163: all
 4164: sorts
 4165: of
 4166: things—i
 4167: can’t
 4168: remember
 4169: half
 4170: of
 4171: them—and
 4172: it
 4173: belongs
 4174: to
 4175: a
 4176: farmer
 4177: you
 4178: know
 4179: and
 4180: he
 4181: says
 4182: it’s
 4183: so
 4184: useful
 4185: it’s
 4186: worth
 4187: a
 4188: hundred
 4189: pounds
 4190: he
 4191: says
 4192: it
 4193: kills
 4194: all
 4195: the
 4196: rats
 4197: and—oh
 4198: dear
 4199: cried
 4200: alice
 4201: in
 4202: a
 4203: sorrowful
 4204: tone
 4205: i’m
 4206: afraid
 4207: i’ve
 4208: offended
 4209: it
 4210: again
 4211: for
 4212: the
 4213: mouse
 4214: was
 4215: swimming
 4216: away
 4217: from
 4218: her
 4219: as
 4220: hard
 4221: as
 4222: it
 4223: could
 4224: go
 4225: and
 4226: making
 4227: quite
 4228: a
 4229: commotion
 4230: in
 4231: the
 4232: pool
 4233: as
 4234: it
 4235: went
 4236: so
 4237: she
 4238: called
 4239: softly
 4240: after
 4241: it
 4242: mouse
 4243: dear
 4244: do
 4245: come
 4246: back
 4247: again
 4248: and
 4249: we
 4250: won’t
 4251: talk
 4252: about
 4253: cats
 4254: or
 4255: dogs
 4256: either
 4257: if
 4258: you
 4259: don’t
 4260: like
 4261: them
 4262: when
 4263: the
 4264: mouse
 4265: heard
 4266: this
 4267: it
 4268: turned
 4269: round
 4270: and
 4271: swam
 4272: slowly
 4273: back
 4274: to
 4275: her
 4276: its
 4277: face
 4278: was
 4279: quite
 4280: pale
 4281: with
 4282: passion
 4283: alice
 4284: thought
 4285: and
 4286: it
 4287: said
 4288: in
 4289: a
 4290: low
 4291: trembling
 4292: voice
 4293: let
 4294: us
 4295: get
 4296: to
 4297: the
 4298: shore
 4299: and
 4300: then
 4301: i’ll
 4302: tell
 4303: you
 4304: my
 4305: history
 4306: and
 4307: you’ll
 4308: understand
 4309: why
 4310: it
 4311: is
 4312: i
 4313: hate
 4314: cats
 4315: and
 4316: dogs
 4317: it
 4318: was
 4319: high
 4320: time
 4321: to
 4322: go
 4323: for
 4324: the
 4325: pool
 4326: was
 4327: getting
 4328: quite
 4329: crowded
 4330: with
 4331: the
 4332: birds
 4333: and
 4334: animals
 4335: that
 4336: had
 4337: fallen
 4338: into
 4339: it
 4340: there
 4341: were
 4342: a
 4343: duck
 4344: and
 4345: a
 4346: dodo
 4347: a
 4348: lory
 4349: and
 4350: an
 4351: eaglet
 4352: and
 4353: several
 4354: other
 4355: curious
 4356: creatures
 4357: alice
 4358: led
 4359: the
 4360: way
 4361: and
 4362: the
 4363: whole
 4364: party
 4365: swam
 4366: to
 4367: the
 4368: shore
 4369: chapter
 4370: iii
 4371: a
 4372: caucus-race
 4373: and
 4374: a
 4375: long
 4376: tale
 4377: they
 4378: were
 4379: indeed
 4380: a
 4381: queer-looking
 4382: party
 4383: that
 4384: assembled
 4385: on
 4386: the
 4387: bank—the
 4388: birds
 4389: with
 4390: draggled
 4391: feathers
 4392: the
 4393: animals
 4394: with
 4395: their
 4396: fur
 4397: clinging
 4398: close
 4399: to
 4400: them
 4401: and
 4402: all
 4403: dripping
 4404: wet
 4405: cross
 4406: and
 4407: uncomfortable
 4408: the
 4409: first
 4410: question
 4411: of
 4412: course
 4413: was
 4414: how
 4415: to
 4416: get
 4417: dry
 4418: again
 4419: they
 4420: had
 4421: a
 4422: consultation
 4423: about
 4424: this
 4425: and
 4426: after
 4427: a
 4428: few
 4429: minutes
 4430: it
 4431: seemed
 4432: quite
 4433: natural
 4434: to
 4435: alice
 4436: to
 4437: find
 4438: herself
 4439: talking
 4440: familiarly
 4441: with
 4442: them
 4443: as
 4444: if
 4445: she
 4446: had
 4447: known
 4448: them
 4449: all
 4450: her
 4451: life
 4452: indeed
 4453: she
 4454: had
 4455: quite
 4456: a
 4457: long
 4458: argument
 4459: with
 4460: the
 4461: lory
 4462: who
 4463: at
 4464: last
 4465: turned
 4466: sulky
 4467: and
 4468: would
 4469: only
 4470: say
 4471: i
 4472: am
 4473: older
 4474: than
 4475: you
 4476: and
 4477: must
 4478: know
 4479: better
 4480: and
 4481: this
 4482: alice
 4483: would
 4484: not
 4485: allow
 4486: without
 4487: knowing
 4488: how
 4489: old
 4490: it
 4491: was
 4492: and
 4493: as
 4494: the
 4495: lory
 4496: positively
 4497: refused
 4498: to
 4499: tell
 4500: its
 4501: age
 4502: there
 4503: was
 4504: no
 4505: more
 4506: to
 4507: be
 4508: said
 4509: at
 4510: last
 4511: the
 4512: mouse
 4513: who
 4514: seemed
 4515: to
 4516: be
 4517: a
 4518: person
 4519: of
 4520: authority
 4521: among
 4522: them
 4523: called
 4524: out

 4526: down
 4527: all
 4528: of
 4529: you
 4530: and
 4531: listen
 4532: to
 4533: me
 4534: i’ll
 4535: soon
 4536: make
 4537: you
 4538: dry
 4539: enough
 4540: they
 4541: all
 4542: sat
 4543: down
 4544: at
 4545: once
 4546: in
 4547: a
 4548: large
 4549: ring
 4550: with
 4551: the
 4552: mouse
 4553: in
 4554: the
 4555: middle
 4556: alice
 4557: kept
 4558: her
 4559: eyes
 4560: anxiously
 4561: fixed
 4562: on
 4563: it
 4564: for
 4565: she
 4566: felt
 4567: sure
 4568: she
 4569: would
 4570: catch
 4571: a
 4572: bad
 4573: cold
 4574: if
 4575: she
 4576: did
 4577: not
 4578: get
 4579: dry
 4580: very
 4581: soon
 4582: ahem
 4583: said
 4584: the

 4588: important

 4653: shiver

 4655: beg
 4656: your
 4657: pardon
 4658: said
 4659: the
 4660: mouse

 4662: but
 4663: very
 4664: politely
 4665: did

 4717: crossly
 4718: of

 4871: i
 4872: don’t
 4873: believe
 4874: you
 4875: do
 4876: either
 4877: and
 4878: the
 4879: eaglet
 4880: bent
 4881: down
 4882: its
 4883: head
 4884: to
 4885: hide
 4886: a
 4887: smile
 4888: some
 4889: of
 4890: the
 4891: other
 4892: birds
 4893: tittered
 4894: audibly
 4895: what
 4896: i
 4897: was
 4898: going
 4899: to
 4900: say
 4901: said
 4902: the
 4903: dodo
 4904: in
 4905: an
 4906: offended
 4907: tone
 4908: was
 4909: that
 4910: the
 4911: best
 4912: thing
 4913: to
 4914: get
 4915: us
 4916: dry
 4917: would
 4918: be
 4919: a
 4920: caucus-race
 4921: what
 4922: is
 4923: a
 4924: caucus-race
 4925: said
 4926: alice
 4927: not
 4928: that
 4929: she
 4930: wanted
 4931: much
 4932: to
 4933: know
 4934: but
 4935: the
 4936: dodo
 4937: had
 4938: paused
 4939: as
 4940: if
 4941: it
 4942: thought
 4943: that
 4944: somebody
 4945: ought
 4946: to
 4947: speak
 4948: and
 4949: no
 4950: one
 4951: else
 4952: seemed
 4953: inclined
 4954: to
 4955: say
 4956: anything
 4957: why
 4958: said
 4959: the
 4960: dodo
 4961: the
 4962: best
 4963: way
 4964: to
 4965: explain
 4966: it
 4967: is
 4968: to
 4969: do
 4970: it
 4971: and
 4972: as
 4973: you
 4974: might
 4975: like
 4976: to
 4977: try
 4978: the
 4979: thing
 4980: yourself
 4981: some
 4982: winter
 4983: day
 4984: i
 4985: will
 4986: tell
 4987: you
 4988: how
 4989: the
 4990: dodo
 4991: managed
 4992: it
 4993: first
 4994: it
 4995: marked
 4996: out
 4997: a
 4998: race-course
 4999: in
 5000: a
 5001: sort
 5002: of
 5003: circle
 5004: the
 5005: exact
 5006: shape
 5007: doesn’t
 5008: matter
 5009: it
 5010: said
 5011: and
 5012: then
 5013: all
 5014: the
 5015: party
 5016: were
 5017: placed
 5018: along
 5019: the
 5020: course
 5021: here
 5022: and
 5023: there
 5024: there
 5025: was
 5026: no
 5027: one
 5028: two
 5029: three
 5030: and
 5031: away
 5032: but
 5033: they
 5034: began
 5035: running
 5036: when
 5037: they
 5038: liked
 5039: and
 5040: left
 5041: off
 5042: when
 5043: they
 5044: liked
 5045: so
 5046: that
 5047: it
 5048: was
 5049: not
 5050: easy
 5051: to
 5052: know
 5053: when
 5054: the
 5055: race
 5056: was
 5057: over
 5058: however
 5059: when
 5060: they
 5061: had
 5062: been
 5063: running
 5064: half
 5065: an
 5066: hour
 5067: or
 5068: so
 5069: and
 5070: were
 5071: quite
 5072: dry
 5073: again
 5074: the
 5075: dodo
 5076: suddenly
 5077: called
 5078: out
 5079: the
 5080: race
 5081: is
 5082: over
 5083: and
 5084: they
 5085: all
 5086: crowded
 5087: round
 5088: it
 5089: panting
 5090: and
 5091: asking
 5092: but
 5093: who
 5094: has
 5095: won
 5096: this
 5097: question
 5098: the
 5099: dodo
 5100: could
 5101: not
 5102: answer
 5103: without
 5104: a
 5105: great
 5106: deal
 5107: of
 5108: thought
 5109: and
 5110: it
 5111: sat
 5112: for
 5113: a
 5114: long
 5115: time
 5116: with
 5117: one
 5118: finger
 5119: pressed
 5120: upon
 5121: its
 5122: forehead
 5123: the
 5124: position
 5125: in
 5126: which
 5127: you
 5128: usually
 5129: see
 5130: shakespeare
 5131: in
 5132: the
 5133: pictures
 5134: of
 5135: him
 5136: while
 5137: the
 5138: rest
 5139: waited
 5140: in
 5141: silence
 5142: at
 5143: last
 5144: the
 5145: dodo
 5146: said
 5147: everybody
 5148: has
 5149: won
 5150: and
 5151: all
 5152: must
 5153: have
 5154: prizes
 5155: but
 5156: who
 5157: is
 5158: to
 5159: give
 5160: the
 5161: prizes
 5162: quite
 5163: a
 5164: chorus
 5165: of
 5166: voices
 5167: asked
 5168: why
 5169: she
 5170: of
 5171: course
 5172: said
 5173: the
 5174: dodo
 5175: pointing
 5176: to
 5177: alice
 5178: with
 5179: one
 5180: finger
 5181: and
 5182: the
 5183: whole
 5184: party
 5185: at
 5186: once
 5187: crowded
 5188: round
 5189: her
 5190: calling
 5191: out
 5192: in
 5193: a
 5194: confused
 5195: way
 5196: prizes
 5197: prizes
 5198: alice
 5199: had
 5200: no
 5201: idea
 5202: what
 5203: to
 5204: do
 5205: and
 5206: in
 5207: despair
 5208: she
 5209: put
 5210: her
 5211: hand
 5212: in
 5213: her
 5214: pocket
 5215: and
 5216: pulled
 5217: out
 5218: a
 5219: box
 5220: of
 5221: comfits
 5222: luckily
 5223: the
 5224: salt
 5225: water
 5226: had
 5227: not
 5228: got
 5229: into
 5230: it
 5231: and
 5232: handed
 5233: them
 5234: round
 5235: as
 5236: prizes
 5237: there
 5238: was
 5239: exactly
 5240: one
 5241: a-piece
 5242: all
 5243: round
 5244: but
 5245: she
 5246: must
 5247: have
 5248: a
 5249: prize
 5250: herself
 5251: you
 5252: know
 5253: said
 5254: the
 5255: mouse
 5256: of
 5257: course
 5258: the
 5259: dodo
 5260: replied
 5261: very
 5262: gravely
 5263: what
 5264: else
 5265: have
 5266: you
 5267: got
 5268: in
 5269: your
 5270: pocket
 5271: he
 5272: went
 5273: on
 5274: turning
 5275: to
 5276: alice
 5277: only
 5278: a
 5279: thimble
 5280: said
 5281: alice
 5282: sadly
 5283: hand
 5284: it
 5285: over
 5286: here
 5287: said
 5288: the
 5289: dodo
 5290: then
 5291: they
 5292: all
 5293: crowded
 5294: round
 5295: her
 5296: once
 5297: more
 5298: while
 5299: the
 5300: dodo
 5301: solemnly
 5302: presented
 5303: the
 5304: thimble
 5305: saying
 5306: we
 5307: beg
 5308: your
 5309: acceptance
 5310: of
 5311: this
 5312: elegant
 5313: thimble
 5314: and
 5315: when
 5316: it
 5317: had
 5318: finished
 5319: this
 5320: short
 5321: speech
 5322: they
 5323: all
 5324: cheered
 5325: alice
 5326: thought
 5327: the
 5328: whole
 5329: thing
 5330: very
 5331: absurd
 5332: but
 5333: they
 5334: all
 5335: looked
 5336: so
 5337: grave
 5338: that
 5339: she
 5340: did
 5341: not
 5342: dare
 5343: to
 5344: laugh
 5345: and
 5346: as
 5347: she
 5348: could
 5349: not
 5350: think
 5351: of
 5352: anything
 5353: to
 5354: say
 5355: she
 5356: simply
 5357: bowed
 5358: and
 5359: took
 5360: the
 5361: thimble
 5362: looking
 5363: as
 5364: solemn
 5365: as
 5366: she
 5367: could
 5368: the
 5369: next
 5370: thing
 5371: was
 5372: to
 5373: eat
 5374: the
 5375: comfits
 5376: this
 5377: caused
 5378: some
 5379: noise
 5380: and
 5381: confusion
 5382: as
 5383: the
 5384: large
 5385: birds
 5386: complained
 5387: that
 5388: they
 5389: could
 5390: not
 5391: taste
 5392: theirs
 5393: and
 5394: the
 5395: small
 5396: ones
 5397: choked
 5398: and
 5399: had
 5400: to
 5401: be
 5402: patted
 5403: on
 5404: the
 5405: back
 5406: however
 5407: it
 5408: was
 5409: over
 5410: at
 5411: last
 5412: and
 5413: they
 5414: sat
 5415: down
 5416: again
 5417: in
 5418: a
 5419: ring
 5420: and
 5421: begged
 5422: the
 5423: mouse
 5424: to
 5425: tell
 5426: them
 5427: something
 5428: more
 5429: you
 5430: promised
 5431: to
 5432: tell
 5433: me
 5434: your
 5435: history
 5436: you
 5437: know
 5438: said
 5439: alice
 5440: and
 5441: why
 5442: it
 5443: is
 5444: you
 5445: hate—c
 5446: and
 5447: d
 5448: she
 5449: added
 5450: in
 5451: a
 5452: whisper
 5453: half
 5454: afraid
 5455: that
 5456: it
 5457: would
 5458: be
 5459: offended
 5460: again
 5461: mine
 5462: is
 5463: a
 5464: long
 5465: and
 5466: a
 5467: sad
 5468: tale
 5469: said
 5470: the
 5471: mouse
 5472: turning
 5473: to
 5474: alice
 5475: and
 5476: sighing
 5477: it
 5478: is
 5479: a
 5480: long
 5481: tail
 5482: certainly
 5483: said
 5484: alice
 5485: looking
 5486: down
 5487: with
 5488: wonder
 5489: at
 5490: the
 5491: mouse’s
 5492: tail
 5493: but
 5494: why
 5495: do
 5496: you
 5497: call
 5498: it
 5499: sad
 5500: and
 5501: she
 5502: kept
 5503: on
 5504: puzzling
 5505: about
 5506: it
 5507: while
 5508: the
 5509: mouse
 5510: was
 5511: speaking
 5512: so
 5513: that
 5514: her
 5515: idea
 5516: of
 5517: the
 5518: tale
 5519: was
 5520: something
 5521: like
 5522: this
 5523: fury
 5524: said
 5525: to
 5526: a
 5527: mouse
 5528: that
 5529: he
 5530: met
 5531: in
 5532: the
 5533: house
 5534: let
 5535: us
 5536: both
 5537: go

 5556: morning
 5557: i’ve
 5558: nothing
 5559: to

 5564: to
 5565: the
 5566: cur
 5567: such
 5568: a
 5569: trial
 5570: dear

 5607: the

 5610: alice
 5611: severely
 5612: what
 5613: are

 5615: thinking
 5616: of

 5640: sharply
 5641: and
 5642: very
 5643: angrily
 5644: a
 5645: knot
 5646: said
 5647: alice
 5648: always
 5649: ready
 5650: to
 5651: make
 5652: herself
 5653: useful

 5679: and
 5680: walking
 5681: away
 5682: you
 5683: insult
 5684: me
 5685: by
 5686: talking
 5687: such
 5688: nonsense
 5689: i
 5690: didn’t
 5691: mean
 5692: it
 5693: pleaded
 5694: poor
 5695: alice
 5696: but
 5697: you’re
 5698: so
 5699: easily
 5700: offended
 5701: you
 5702: know
 5703: the
 5704: mouse
 5705: only
 5706: growled
 5707: in

 5725: in
 5726: chorus
 5727: yes
 5728: please
 5729: do
 5730: but
 5731: the
 5732: mouse
 5733: only
 5734: shook
 5735: its
 5736: head
 5737: impatiently
 5738: and
 5739: walked
 5740: a
 5741: little
 5742: quicker
 5743: what
 5744: a
 5745: pity
 5746: it
 5747: wouldn’t
 5748: stay
 5749: sighed
 5750: the
 5751: lory
 5752: as
 5753: soon
 5754: as
 5755: it
 5756: was
 5757: quite
 5758: out
 5759: of
 5760: sight
 5761: and
 5762: an
 5763: old
 5764: crab
 5765: took
 5766: the
 5767: opportunity
 5768: of
 5769: saying
 5770: to
 5771: her
 5772: daughter
 5773: ah
 5774: my
 5775: dear
 5776: let
 5777: this
 5778: be
 5779: a
 5780: lesson
 5781: to
 5782: you
 5783: never
 5784: to
 5785: lose
 5786: your
 5787: temper
 5788: hold
 5789: your
 5790: tongue
 5791: ma
 5792: said
 5793: the
 5794: young
 5795: crab
 5796: a
 5797: little
 5798: snappishly
 5799: you’re
 5800: enough
 5801: to
 5802: try
 5803: the
 5804: patience
 5805: of
 5806: an
 5807: oyster
 5808: i
 5809: wish
 5810: i
 5811: had
 5812: our
 5813: dinah
 5814: here
 5815: i
 5816: know
 5817: i
 5818: do
 5819: said
 5820: alice
 5821: aloud
 5822: addressing
 5823: nobody
 5824: in
 5825: particular
 5826: she’d
 5827: soon
 5828: fetch
 5829: it
 5830: back
 5831: and
 5832: who
 5833: is
 5834: dinah
 5835: if
 5836: i
 5837: might
 5838: venture
 5839: to
 5840: ask
 5841: the
 5842: question
 5843: said
 5844: the
 5845: lory
 5846: alice
 5847: replied
 5848: eagerly
 5849: for
 5850: she
 5851: was
 5852: always
 5853: ready
 5854: to
 5855: talk
 5856: about
 5857: her
 5858: pet
 5859: dinah’s
 5860: our
 5861: cat
 5862: and
 5863: she’s
 5864: such
 5865: a
 5866: capital
 5867: one
 5868: for
 5869: catching
 5870: mice
 5871: you
 5872: can’t
 5873: think
 5874: and
 5875: oh
 5876: i
 5877: wish
 5878: you
 5879: could
 5880: see
 5881: her
 5882: after
 5883: the
 5884: birds
 5885: why
 5886: she’ll
 5887: eat
 5888: a
 5889: little
 5890: bird
 5891: as
 5892: soon
 5893: as
 5894: look
 5895: at
 5896: it
 5897: this
 5898: speech
 5899: caused
 5900: a
 5901: remarkable
 5902: sensation
 5903: among
 5904: the
 5905: party
 5906: some
 5907: of
 5908: the
 5909: birds
 5910: hurried
 5911: off
 5912: at
 5913: once
 5914: one
 5915: old
 5916: magpie
 5917: began
 5918: wrapping
 5919: itself
 5920: up
 5921: very
 5922: carefully
 5923: remarking
 5924: i
 5925: really
 5926: must
 5927: be
 5928: getting
 5929: home
 5930: the
 5931: night-air
 5932: doesn’t
 5933: suit
 5934: my
 5935: throat
 5936: and
 5937: a
 5938: canary
 5939: called
 5940: out
 5941: in
 5942: a
 5943: trembling
 5944: voice
 5945: to
 5946: its
 5947: children
 5948: come
 5949: away
 5950: my
 5951: dears
 5952: it’s
 5953: high
 5954: time
 5955: you
 5956: were
 5957: all
 5958: in
 5959: bed
 5960: on
 5961: various
 5962: pretexts
 5963: they
 5964: all
 5965: moved
 5966: off
 5967: and
 5968: alice
 5969: was
 5970: soon
 5971: left
 5972: alone
 5973: i
 5974: wish
 5975: i
 5976: hadn’t
 5977: mentioned
 5978: dinah
 5979: she
 5980: said
 5981: to
 5982: herself
 5983: in
 5984: a
 5985: melancholy
 5986: tone
 5987: nobody
 5988: seems
 5989: to
 5990: like
 5991: her
 5992: down
 5993: here
 5994: and
 5995: i’m
 5996: sure
 5997: she’s
 5998: the
 5999: best
 6000: cat
 6001: in
 6002: the
 6003: world
 6004: oh
 6005: my
 6006: dear
 6007: dinah
 6008: i
 6009: wonder
 6010: if
 6011: i
 6012: shall
 6013: ever
 6014: see
 6015: you
 6016: any
 6017: more
 6018: and
 6019: here
 6020: poor
 6021: alice
 6022: began
 6023: to
 6024: cry
 6025: again
 6026: for
 6027: she
 6028: felt
 6029: very
 6030: lonely
 6031: and
 6032: low-spirited
 6033: in
 6034: a
 6035: little
 6036: while
 6037: however
 6038: she
 6039: again
 6040: heard
 6041: a
 6042: little
 6043: pattering
 6044: of
 6045: footsteps
 6046: in
 6047: the
 6048: distance
 6049: and
 6050: she
 6051: looked
 6052: up
 6053: eagerly
 6054: half
 6055: hoping
 6056: that
 6057: the
 6058: mouse
 6059: had
 6060: changed
 6061: his
 6062: mind
 6063: and
 6064: was
 6065: coming
 6066: back
 6067: to
 6068: finish
 6069: his
 6070: story
 6071: chapter
 6072: iv
 6073: the
 6074: rabbit
 6075: sends
 6076: in
 6077: a
 6078: little
 6079: bill
 6080: it
 6081: was
 6082: the
 6083: white
 6084: rabbit
 6085: trotting
 6086: slowly
 6087: back
 6088: again
 6089: and
 6090: looking
 6091: anxiously
 6092: about
 6093: as
 6094: it
 6095: went
 6096: as
 6097: if
 6098: it
 6099: had
 6100: lost
 6101: something
 6102: and
 6103: she
 6104: heard
 6105: it
 6106: muttering
 6107: to
 6108: itself
 6109: the
 6110: duchess
 6111: the
 6112: duchess
 6113: oh
 6114: my
 6115: dear
 6116: paws
 6117: oh
 6118: my
 6119: fur
 6120: and
 6121: whiskers
 6122: she’ll
 6123: get
 6124: me
 6125: executed
 6126: as
 6127: sure
 6128: as
 6129: ferrets
 6130: are
 6131: ferrets
 6132: where
 6133: can
 6134: i
 6135: have
 6136: dropped
 6137: them
 6138: i
 6139: wonder
 6140: alice
 6141: guessed
 6142: in
 6143: a
 6144: moment
 6145: that
 6146: it
 6147: was
 6148: looking
 6149: for
 6150: the
 6151: fan
 6152: and
 6153: the
 6154: pair
 6155: of
 6156: white
 6157: kid
 6158: gloves
 6159: and
 6160: she
 6161: very
 6162: good-naturedly
 6163: began
 6164: hunting
 6165: about
 6166: for
 6167: them
 6168: but
 6169: they
 6170: were
 6171: nowhere
 6172: to
 6173: be
 6174: seen—everything
 6175: seemed
 6176: to
 6177: have
 6178: changed
 6179: since
 6180: her
 6181: swim
 6182: in
 6183: the
 6184: pool
 6185: and
 6186: the
 6187: great
 6188: hall
 6189: with
 6190: the
 6191: glass
 6192: table
 6193: and
 6194: the
 6195: little
 6196: door
 6197: had
 6198: vanished
 6199: completely
 6200: very
 6201: soon
 6202: the
 6203: rabbit
 6204: noticed
 6205: alice
 6206: as
 6207: she
 6208: went
 6209: hunting
 6210: about
 6211: and
 6212: called
 6213: out
 6214: to
 6215: her
 6216: in
 6217: an
 6218: angry
 6219: tone
 6220: why
 6221: mary
 6222: ann
 6223: what
 6224: are
 6225: you
 6226: doing
 6227: out
 6228: here
 6229: run
 6230: home
 6231: this
 6232: moment
 6233: and
 6234: fetch
 6235: me
 6236: a
 6237: pair
 6238: of
 6239: gloves
 6240: and
 6241: a
 6242: fan
 6243: quick
 6244: now
 6245: and
 6246: alice
 6247: was
 6248: so
 6249: much
 6250: frightened
 6251: that
 6252: she
 6253: ran
 6254: off
 6255: at
 6256: once
 6257: in
 6258: the
 6259: direction
 6260: it
 6261: pointed
 6262: to
 6263: without
 6264: trying
 6265: to
 6266: explain
 6267: the
 6268: mistake
 6269: it
 6270: had
 6271: made
 6272: he
 6273: took
 6274: me
 6275: for
 6276: his
 6277: housemaid
 6278: she
 6279: said
 6280: to
 6281: herself
 6282: as
 6283: she
 6284: ran
 6285: how
 6286: surprised
 6287: he’ll
 6288: be
 6289: when
 6290: he
 6291: finds
 6292: out
 6293: who
 6294: i
 6295: am
 6296: but
 6297: i’d
 6298: better
 6299: take
 6300: him
 6301: his
 6302: fan
 6303: and
 6304: gloves—that
 6305: is
 6306: if
 6307: i
 6308: can
 6309: find
 6310: them
 6311: as
 6312: she
 6313: said
 6314: this
 6315: she
 6316: came
 6317: upon
 6318: a
 6319: neat
 6320: little
 6321: house
 6322: on
 6323: the
 6324: door
 6325: of
 6326: which
 6327: was
 6328: a
 6329: bright
 6330: brass
 6331: plate
 6332: with
 6333: the
 6334: name
 6335: w
 6336: rabbit
 6337: engraved
 6338: upon
 6339: it
 6340: she
 6341: went
 6342: in
 6343: without
 6344: knocking
 6345: and
 6346: hurried
 6347: upstairs
 6348: in
 6349: great
 6350: fear
 6351: lest
 6352: she
 6353: should
 6354: meet
 6355: the
 6356: real
 6357: mary
 6358: ann
 6359: and
 6360: be
 6361: turned
 6362: out
 6363: of
 6364: the
 6365: house
 6366: before
 6367: she
 6368: had
 6369: found
 6370: the
 6371: fan
 6372: and
 6373: gloves
 6374: how
 6375: queer
 6376: it
 6377: seems
 6378: alice
 6379: said
 6380: to
 6381: herself
 6382: to
 6383: be
 6384: going
 6385: messages
 6386: for
 6387: a
 6388: rabbit
 6389: i
 6390: suppose
 6391: dinah’ll
 6392: be
 6393: sending
 6394: me
 6395: on
 6396: messages
 6397: next
 6398: and
 6399: she
 6400: began
 6401: fancying
 6402: the
 6403: sort
 6404: of
 6405: thing
 6406: that
 6407: would
 6408: happen
 6409: miss
 6410: alice
 6411: come
 6412: here
 6413: directly
 6414: and
 6415: get
 6416: ready
 6417: for
 6418: your
 6419: walk
 6420: coming
 6421: in
 6422: a
 6423: minute
 6424: nurse
 6425: but
 6426: i’ve
 6427: got
 6428: to
 6429: see
 6430: that
 6431: the
 6432: mouse
 6433: doesn’t
 6434: get
 6435: out
 6436: only
 6437: i
 6438: don’t
 6439: think
 6440: alice
 6441: went
 6442: on
 6443: that
 6444: they’d
 6445: let
 6446: dinah
 6447: stop
 6448: in
 6449: the
 6450: house
 6451: if
 6452: it
 6453: began
 6454: ordering
 6455: people
 6456: about
 6457: like
 6458: that
 6459: by
 6460: this
 6461: time
 6462: she
 6463: had
 6464: found
 6465: her
 6466: way
 6467: into
 6468: a
 6469: tidy
 6470: little
 6471: room
 6472: with
 6473: a
 6474: table
 6475: in
 6476: the
 6477: window
 6478: and
 6479: on
 6480: it
 6481: as
 6482: she
 6483: had
 6484: hoped
 6485: a
 6486: fan
 6487: and
 6488: two
 6489: or
 6490: three
 6491: pairs
 6492: of
 6493: tiny
 6494: white
 6495: kid
 6496: gloves
 6497: she
 6498: took
 6499: up
 6500: the
 6501: fan
 6502: and
 6503: a
 6504: pair
 6505: of
 6506: the
 6507: gloves
 6508: and
 6509: was
 6510: just
 6511: going
 6512: to
 6513: leave
 6514: the
 6515: room
 6516: when
 6517: her
 6518: eye
 6519: fell
 6520: upon
 6521: a
 6522: little
 6523: bottle
 6524: that
 6525: stood
 6526: near
 6527: the
 6528: looking-glass
 6529: there
 6530: was
 6531: no
 6532: label
 6533: this
 6534: time
 6535: with
 6536: the
 6537: words
 6538: drink
 6539: me
 6540: but
 6541: nevertheless
 6542: she
 6543: uncorked
 6544: it
 6545: and
 6546: put
 6547: it
 6548: to
 6549: her
 6550: lips
 6551: i
 6552: know
 6553: something
 6554: interesting
 6555: is
 6556: sure
 6557: to
 6558: happen
 6559: she
 6560: said
 6561: to
 6562: herself
 6563: whenever
 6564: i
 6565: eat
 6566: or
 6567: drink
 6568: anything
 6569: so
 6570: i’ll
 6571: just
 6572: see
 6573: what
 6574: this
 6575: bottle
 6576: does
 6577: i
 6578: do
 6579: hope
 6580: it’ll
 6581: make
 6582: me
 6583: grow
 6584: large
 6585: again
 6586: for
 6587: really
 6588: i’m
 6589: quite
 6590: tired
 6591: of
 6592: being
 6593: such
 6594: a
 6595: tiny
 6596: little
 6597: thing
 6598: it
 6599: did
 6600: so
 6601: indeed
 6602: and
 6603: much
 6604: sooner
 6605: than
 6606: she
 6607: had
 6608: expected
 6609: before
 6610: she
 6611: had
 6612: drunk
 6613: half
 6614: the
 6615: bottle
 6616: she
 6617: found
 6618: her
 6619: head
 6620: pressing
 6621: against
 6622: the
 6623: ceiling
 6624: and
 6625: had
 6626: to
 6627: stoop
 6628: to
 6629: save
 6630: her
 6631: neck
 6632: from
 6633: being
 6634: broken
 6635: she
 6636: hastily
 6637: put
 6638: down
 6639: the
 6640: bottle
 6641: saying
 6642: to
 6643: herself
 6644: that’s
 6645: quite
 6646: enough—i
 6647: hope
 6648: i
 6649: shan’t
 6650: grow
 6651: any
 6652: more—as
 6653: it
 6654: is
 6655: i
 6656: can’t
 6657: get
 6658: out
 6659: at
 6660: the
 6661: door—i
 6662: do
 6663: wish
 6664: i
 6665: hadn’t
 6666: drunk
 6667: quite
 6668: so
 6669: much
 6670: alas
 6671: it
 6672: was
 6673: too
 6674: late
 6675: to
 6676: wish
 6677: that
 6678: she
 6679: went
 6680: on
 6681: growing
 6682: and
 6683: growing
 6684: and
 6685: very
 6686: soon
 6687: had
 6688: to
 6689: kneel
 6690: down
 6691: on
 6692: the
 6693: floor
 6694: in
 6695: another
 6696: minute
 6697: there
 6698: was
 6699: not
 6700: even
 6701: room
 6702: for
 6703: this
 6704: and
 6705: she
 6706: tried
 6707: the
 6708: effect
 6709: of
 6710: lying
 6711: down
 6712: with
 6713: one
 6714: elbow
 6715: against
 6716: the
 6717: door
 6718: and
 6719: the
 6720: other
 6721: arm
 6722: curled
 6723: round
 6724: her
 6725: head
 6726: still
 6727: she
 6728: went
 6729: on
 6730: growing
 6731: and
 6732: as
 6733: a
 6734: last
 6735: resource
 6736: she
 6737: put
 6738: one
 6739: arm
 6740: out
 6741: of
 6742: the
 6743: window
 6744: and
 6745: one
 6746: foot
 6747: up
 6748: the
 6749: chimney
 6750: and
 6751: said
 6752: to
 6753: herself
 6754: now
 6755: i
 6756: can
 6757: do
 6758: no
 6759: more
 6760: whatever
 6761: happens
 6762: what
 6763: will
 6764: become
 6765: of
 6766: me
 6767: luckily
 6768: for
 6769: alice
 6770: the
 6771: little
 6772: magic
 6773: bottle
 6774: had
 6775: now
 6776: had
 6777: its
 6778: full
 6779: effect
 6780: and
 6781: she
 6782: grew
 6783: no
 6784: larger
 6785: still
 6786: it
 6787: was
 6788: very
 6789: uncomfortable
 6790: and
 6791: as
 6792: there
 6793: seemed
 6794: to
 6795: be
 6796: no
 6797: sort
 6798: of
 6799: chance
 6800: of
 6801: her
 6802: ever
 6803: getting
 6804: out
 6805: of
 6806: the
 6807: room
 6808: again
 6809: no
 6810: wonder
 6811: she
 6812: felt
 6813: unhappy
 6814: it
 6815: was
 6816: much
 6817: pleasanter
 6818: at
 6819: home
 6820: thought
 6821: poor
 6822: alice
 6823: when
 6824: one
 6825: wasn’t
 6826: always
 6827: growing
 6828: larger
 6829: and
 6830: smaller
 6831: and
 6832: being
 6833: ordered
 6834: about
 6835: by
 6836: mice
 6837: and
 6838: rabbits
 6839: i
 6840: almost
 6841: wish
 6842: i
 6843: hadn’t
 6844: gone
 6845: down
 6846: that
 6847: rabbit-hole—and
 6848: yet—and
 6849: yet—it’s
 6850: rather
 6851: curious
 6852: you
 6853: know
 6854: this
 6855: sort
 6856: of
 6857: life
 6858: i
 6859: do
 6860: wonder
 6861: what
 6862: can
 6863: have
 6864: happened
 6865: to
 6866: me
 6867: when
 6868: i
 6869: used
 6870: to
 6871: read
 6872: fairy-tales
 6873: i
 6874: fancied
 6875: that
 6876: kind
 6877: of
 6878: thing
 6879: never
 6880: happened
 6881: and
 6882: now
 6883: here
 6884: i
 6885: am
 6886: in
 6887: the
 6888: middle
 6889: of
 6890: one
 6891: there
 6892: ought
 6893: to
 6894: be
 6895: a
 6896: book
 6897: written
 6898: about
 6899: me
 6900: that
 6901: there
 6902: ought
 6903: and
 6904: when
 6905: i
 6906: grow
 6907: up
 6908: i’ll
 6909: write
 6910: one—but
 6911: i’m
 6912: grown
 6913: up
 6914: now
 6915: she
 6916: added
 6917: in
 6918: a
 6919: sorrowful
 6920: tone
 6921: at
 6922: least
 6923: there’s
 6924: no
 6925: room
 6926: to
 6927: grow
 6928: up
 6929: any
 6930: more
 6931: here
 6932: but
 6933: then
 6934: thought
 6935: alice
 6936: shall
 6937: i
 6938: never
 6939: get
 6940: any
 6941: older
 6942: than
 6943: i
 6944: am
 6945: now
 6946: that’ll
 6947: be
 6948: a
 6949: comfort
 6950: one
 6951: way—never
 6952: to
 6953: be
 6954: an
 6955: old
 6956: woman—but
 6957: then—always
 6958: to
 6959: have
 6960: lessons
 6961: to
 6962: learn
 6963: oh
 6964: i
 6965: shouldn’t
 6966: like
 6967: that
 6968: oh
 6969: you
 6970: foolish
 6971: alice
 6972: she
 6973: answered
 6974: herself
 6975: how
 6976: can
 6977: you
 6978: learn
 6979: lessons
 6980: in
 6981: here
 6982: why
 6983: there’s
 6984: hardly
 6985: room
 6986: for
 6987: you
 6988: and
 6989: no
 6990: room
 6991: at
 6992: all
 6993: for
 6994: any
 6995: lesson-books
 6996: and
 6997: so
 6998: she
 6999: went
 7000: on
 7001: taking
 7002: first
 7003: one
 7004: side
 7005: and
 7006: then
 7007: the
 7008: other
 7009: and
 7010: making
 7011: quite
 7012: a
 7013: conversation
 7014: of
 7015: it
 7016: altogether
 7017: but
 7018: after
 7019: a
 7020: few
 7021: minutes
 7022: she
 7023: heard
 7024: a
 7025: voice
 7026: outside
 7027: and
 7028: stopped
 7029: to
 7030: listen
 7031: mary
 7032: ann
 7033: mary
 7034: ann
 7035: said
 7036: the
 7037: voice
 7038: fetch
 7039: me
 7040: my
 7041: gloves
 7042: this
 7043: moment
 7044: then
 7045: came
 7046: a
 7047: little
 7048: pattering
 7049: of
 7050: feet
 7051: on
 7052: the
 7053: stairs
 7054: alice
 7055: knew
 7056: it
 7057: was
 7058: the
 7059: rabbit
 7060: coming
 7061: to
 7062: look
 7063: for
 7064: her
 7065: and
 7066: she
 7067: trembled
 7068: till
 7069: she
 7070: shook
 7071: the
 7072: house
 7073: quite
 7074: forgetting
 7075: that
 7076: she
 7077: was
 7078: now
 7079: about
 7080: a
 7081: thousand
 7082: times
 7083: as
 7084: large
 7085: as
 7086: the
 7087: rabbit
 7088: and
 7089: had
 7090: no
 7091: reason
 7092: to
 7093: be
 7094: afraid
 7095: of
 7096: it
 7097: presently
 7098: the
 7099: rabbit
 7100: came
 7101: up
 7102: to
 7103: the
 7104: door
 7105: and
 7106: tried
 7107: to
 7108: open
 7109: it
 7110: but
 7111: as
 7112: the
 7113: door
 7114: opened
 7115: inwards
 7116: and
 7117: alice’s
 7118: elbow
 7119: was
 7120: pressed
 7121: hard
 7122: against
 7123: it
 7124: that
 7125: attempt
 7126: proved
 7127: a
 7128: failure
 7129: alice
 7130: heard
 7131: it
 7132: say
 7133: to
 7134: itself
 7135: then
 7136: i’ll
 7137: go
 7138: round
 7139: and
 7140: get
 7141: in
 7142: at
 7143: the
 7144: window
 7145: that
 7146: you
 7147: won’t
 7148: thought
 7149: alice
 7150: and
 7151: after
 7152: waiting
 7153: till
 7154: she
 7155: fancied
 7156: she
 7157: heard
 7158: the
 7159: rabbit
 7160: just
 7161: under
 7162: the
 7163: window
 7164: she
 7165: suddenly
 7166: spread
 7167: out
 7168: her
 7169: hand
 7170: and
 7171: made
 7172: a
 7173: snatch
 7174: in
 7175: the
 7176: air
 7177: she
 7178: did
 7179: not
 7180: get
 7181: hold
 7182: of
 7183: anything
 7184: but
 7185: she
 7186: heard
 7187: a
 7188: little
 7189: shriek
 7190: and
 7191: a
 7192: fall
 7193: and
 7194: a
 7195: crash
 7196: of
 7197: broken
 7198: glass
 7199: from
 7200: which
 7201: she
 7202: concluded
 7203: that
 7204: it
 7205: was
 7206: just
 7207: possible
 7208: it
 7209: had
 7210: fallen
 7211: into
 7212: a
 7213: cucumber-frame
 7214: or
 7215: something
 7216: of
 7217: the
 7218: sort
 7219: next
 7220: came
 7221: an
 7222: angry
 7223: voice—the
 7224: rabbit’s—“pat
 7225: pat
 7226: where
 7227: are
 7228: you
 7229: and
 7230: then
 7231: a
 7232: voice
 7233: she
 7234: had
 7235: never
 7236: heard
 7237: before
 7238: sure
 7239: then
 7240: i’m
 7241: here
 7242: digging
 7243: for
 7244: apples
 7245: yer
 7246: honour
 7247: digging
 7248: for
 7249: apples
 7250: indeed
 7251: said
 7252: the
 7253: rabbit
 7254: angrily
 7255: here
 7256: come
 7257: and
 7258: help
 7259: me
 7260: out
 7261: of
 7262: this
 7263: sounds
 7264: of
 7265: more
 7266: broken
 7267: glass
 7268: now
 7269: tell
 7270: me
 7271: pat
 7272: what’s
 7273: that
 7274: in
 7275: the
 7276: window
 7277: sure
 7278: it’s
 7279: an
 7280: arm
 7281: yer
 7282: honour
 7283: he
 7284: pronounced
 7285: it
 7286: arrum
 7287: an
 7288: arm
 7289: you
 7290: goose
 7291: who
 7292: ever
 7293: saw
 7294: one
 7295: that
 7296: size
 7297: why
 7298: it
 7299: fills
 7300: the
 7301: whole
 7302: window
 7303: sure
 7304: it
 7305: does
 7306: yer
 7307: honour
 7308: but
 7309: it’s
 7310: an
 7311: arm
 7312: for
 7313: all
 7314: that
 7315: well
 7316: it’s
 7317: got
 7318: no
 7319: business
 7320: there
 7321: at
 7322: any
 7323: rate
 7324: go
 7325: and
 7326: take
 7327: it
 7328: away
 7329: there
 7330: was
 7331: a
 7332: long
 7333: silence
 7334: after
 7335: this
 7336: and
 7337: alice
 7338: could
 7339: only
 7340: hear
 7341: whispers
 7342: now
 7343: and
 7344: then
 7345: such
 7346: as
 7347: sure
 7348: i
 7349: don’t
 7350: like
 7351: it
 7352: yer
 7353: honour
 7354: at
 7355: all
 7356: at
 7357: all
 7358: do
 7359: as
 7360: i
 7361: tell
 7362: you
 7363: you
 7364: coward
 7365: and
 7366: at
 7367: last
 7368: she
 7369: spread
 7370: out
 7371: her
 7372: hand
 7373: again
 7374: and
 7375: made
 7376: another
 7377: snatch
 7378: in
 7379: the
 7380: air
 7381: this
 7382: time
 7383: there
 7384: were
 7385: two
 7386: little
 7387: shrieks
 7388: and
 7389: more
 7390: sounds
 7391: of
 7392: broken
 7393: glass
 7394: what
 7395: a
 7396: number
 7397: of
 7398: cucumber-frames
 7399: there
 7400: must
 7401: be
 7402: thought
 7403: alice
 7404: i
 7405: wonder
 7406: what
 7407: they’ll
 7408: do
 7409: next
 7410: as
 7411: for
 7412: pulling
 7413: me
 7414: out
 7415: of
 7416: the
 7417: window
 7418: i
 7419: only
 7420: wish
 7421: they
 7422: could
 7423: i’m
 7424: sure
 7425: i
 7426: don’t
 7427: want
 7428: to
 7429: stay
 7430: in
 7431: here
 7432: any
 7433: longer
 7434: she
 7435: waited
 7436: for
 7437: some
 7438: time
 7439: without
 7440: hearing
 7441: anything
 7442: more
 7443: at
 7444: last
 7445: came
 7446: a
 7447: rumbling
 7448: of
 7449: little
 7450: cartwheels
 7451: and
 7452: the
 7453: sound
 7454: of
 7455: a
 7456: good
 7457: many
 7458: voices
 7459: all
 7460: talking
 7461: together
 7462: she
 7463: made
 7464: out
 7465: the
 7466: words
 7467: where’s
 7468: the
 7469: other
 7470: ladder?—why
 7471: i
 7472: hadn’t

 7490: corner—no
 7491: tie
 7492: em
 7493: together
 7494: first—they
 7495: don’t
 7496: reach
 7497: half
 7498: high
 7499: enough
 7500: yet—oh
 7501: they’ll
 7502: do
 7503: well
 7504: enough
 7505: don’t
 7506: be
 7507: particular—here

 7510: hold
 7511: of

 7515: roof
 7516: bear?—mind
 7517: that
 7518: loose
 7519: slate—oh
 7520: it’s
 7521: coming
 7522: down
 7523: heads
 7524: below
 7525: a
 7526: loud
 7527: crash)—“now

 7529: did
 7530: that?—it
 7531: was
 7532: bill
 7533: i

 7537: down
 7538: the
 7539: chimney?—nay
 7540: i
 7541: shan’t
 7542: you
 7543: do
 7544: it!—_that
 7545: i
 7546: won’t
 7547: then!—bill’s
 7548: to
 7549: go
 7550: down—here
 7551: bill
 7552: the
 7553: master
 7554: says
 7555: you’re
 7556: to
 7557: go
 7558: down
 7559: the
 7560: chimney
 7561: oh
 7562: so
 7563: bill’s

 7567: down
 7568: the
 7569: chimney
 7570: has
 7571: he
 7572: said
 7573: alice
 7574: to
 7575: herself
 7576: shy
 7577: they
 7578: seem
 7579: to
 7580: put
 7581: everything
 7582: upon
 7583: bill
 7584: i
 7585: wouldn’t
 7586: be
 7587: in
 7588: bill’s
 7589: place
 7590: for
 7591: a
 7592: good
 7593: deal
 7594: this
 7595: fireplace
 7596: is
 7597: narrow
 7598: to
 7599: be
 7600: sure
 7601: but
 7602: i
 7603: think
 7604: i
 7605: can
 7606: kick
 7607: a
 7608: little
 7609: she
 7610: drew
 7611: her
 7612: foot
 7613: as
 7614: far
 7615: down
 7616: the
 7617: chimney
 7618: as
 7619: she
 7620: could
 7621: and
 7622: waited
 7623: till
 7624: she
 7625: heard
 7626: a
 7627: little
 7628: animal
 7629: she
 7630: couldn’t
 7631: guess
 7632: of
 7633: what
 7634: sort
 7635: it
 7636: was
 7637: scratching
 7638: and
 7639: scrambling
 7640: about
 7641: in
 7642: the
 7643: chimney
 7644: close
 7645: above
 7646: her
 7647: then
 7648: saying
 7649: to
 7650: herself
 7651: this
 7652: is
 7653: bill
 7654: she
 7655: gave
 7656: one
 7657: sharp
 7658: kick
 7659: and
 7660: waited
 7661: to
 7662: see
 7663: what
 7664: would
 7665: happen
 7666: next
 7667: the
 7668: first
 7669: thing
 7670: she
 7671: heard
 7672: was
 7673: a
 7674: general
 7675: chorus
 7676: of
 7677: there
 7678: goes
 7679: bill
 7680: then
 7681: the
 7682: rabbit’s
 7683: voice
 7684: along—“catch
 7685: him
 7686: you
 7687: by
 7688: the
 7689: hedge
 7690: then
 7691: silence
 7692: and
 7693: then
 7694: another
 7695: confusion
 7696: of
 7697: voices—“hold
 7698: up
 7699: his
 7700: head—brandy
 7701: now—don’t
 7702: choke
 7703: him—how
 7704: was
 7705: it
 7706: old
 7707: fellow
 7708: what
 7709: happened
 7710: to
 7711: you
 7712: tell
 7713: us
 7714: all
 7715: about
 7716: it
 7717: last
 7718: came
 7719: a
 7720: little
 7721: feeble
 7722: squeaking
 7723: voice
 7724: that’s
 7725: bill
 7726: thought
 7727: alice
 7728: well
 7729: i
 7730: hardly
 7731: know—no
 7732: more
 7733: thank
 7734: ye
 7735: i’m
 7736: better
 7737: now—but
 7738: i’m
 7739: a
 7740: deal
 7741: too
 7742: flustered
 7743: to
 7744: tell
 7745: you—all
 7746: i
 7747: know
 7748: is
 7749: something
 7750: comes
 7751: at
 7752: me
 7753: like
 7754: a
 7755: jack-in-the-box
 7756: and
 7757: up
 7758: i
 7759: goes
 7760: like
 7761: a
 7762: sky-rocket
 7763: so
 7764: you
 7765: did
 7766: old
 7767: fellow
 7768: said
 7769: the
 7770: others
 7771: we
 7772: must
 7773: burn
 7774: the
 7775: house
 7776: down
 7777: said
 7778: the
 7779: rabbit’s
 7780: voice
 7781: and
 7782: alice
 7783: called
 7784: out
 7785: as
 7786: loud
 7787: as
 7788: she
 7789: could
 7790: if
 7791: you
 7792: do
 7793: i’ll
 7794: set
 7795: dinah
 7796: at
 7797: you
 7798: there
 7799: was
 7800: a
 7801: dead
 7802: silence
 7803: instantly
 7804: and
 7805: alice
 7806: thought
 7807: to
 7808: herself
 7809: i
 7810: wonder
 7811: what
 7812: they
 7813: will
 7814: do
 7815: next
 7816: if
 7817: they
 7818: had
 7819: any
 7820: sense
 7821: they’d
 7822: take
 7823: the
 7824: roof
 7825: off
 7826: after
 7827: a
 7828: minute
 7829: or
 7830: two
 7831: they
 7832: began
 7833: moving
 7834: about
 7835: again
 7836: and
 7837: alice
 7838: heard
 7839: the
 7840: rabbit
 7841: say
 7842: a
 7843: barrowful
 7844: will
 7845: do
 7846: to
 7847: begin
 7848: with
 7849: a
 7850: barrowful
 7851: of
 7852: what
 7853: thought
 7854: alice
 7855: but
 7856: she
 7857: had
 7858: not
 7859: long
 7860: to
 7861: doubt
 7862: for
 7863: the
 7864: next
 7865: moment
 7866: a
 7867: shower
 7868: of
 7869: little
 7870: pebbles
 7871: came
 7872: rattling
 7873: in
 7874: at
 7875: the
 7876: window
 7877: and
 7878: some
 7879: of
 7880: them
 7881: hit
 7882: her
 7883: in
 7884: the
 7885: face
 7886: i’ll
 7887: put
 7888: a
 7889: stop
 7890: to
 7891: this
 7892: she
 7893: said
 7894: to
 7895: herself
 7896: and
 7897: shouted
 7898: out
 7899: you’d
 7900: better
 7901: not
 7902: do
 7903: that
 7904: again
 7905: which
 7906: produced
 7907: another
 7908: dead
 7909: silence
 7910: alice
 7911: noticed
 7912: with
 7913: some
 7914: surprise
 7915: that
 7916: the
 7917: pebbles
 7918: were
 7919: all
 7920: turning
 7921: into
 7922: little
 7923: cakes
 7924: as
 7925: they
 7926: lay
 7927: on
 7928: the
 7929: floor
 7930: and
 7931: a
 7932: bright
 7933: idea
 7934: came
 7935: into
 7936: her
 7937: head
 7938: if
 7939: i
 7940: eat
 7941: one
 7942: of
 7943: these
 7944: cakes
 7945: she
 7946: thought
 7947: it’s
 7948: sure
 7949: to
 7950: make
 7951: some
 7952: change
 7953: in
 7954: my
 7955: size
 7956: and
 7957: as
 7958: it
 7959: can’t
 7960: possibly
 7961: make
 7962: me
 7963: larger
 7964: it
 7965: must
 7966: make
 7967: me
 7968: smaller
 7969: i
 7970: suppose
 7971: so
 7972: she
 7973: swallowed
 7974: one
 7975: of
 7976: the
 7977: cakes
 7978: and
 7979: was
 7980: delighted
 7981: to
 7982: find
 7983: that
 7984: she
 7985: began
 7986: shrinking
 7987: directly
 7988: as
 7989: soon
 7990: as
 7991: she
 7992: was
 7993: small
 7994: enough
 7995: to
 7996: get
 7997: through
 7998: the
 7999: door
 8000: she
 8001: ran
 8002: out
 8003: of
 8004: the
 8005: house
 8006: and
 8007: found
 8008: quite
 8009: a
 8010: crowd
 8011: of
 8012: little
 8013: animals
 8014: and
 8015: birds
 8016: waiting
 8017: outside
 8018: the
 8019: poor
 8020: little
 8021: lizard
 8022: bill
 8023: was
 8024: in
 8025: the
 8026: middle
 8027: being
 8028: held
 8029: up
 8030: by
 8031: two
 8032: guinea-pigs
 8033: who
 8034: were
 8035: giving
 8036: it
 8037: something
 8038: out
 8039: of
 8040: a
 8041: bottle
 8042: they
 8043: all
 8044: made
 8045: a
 8046: rush
 8047: at
 8048: alice
 8049: the
 8050: moment
 8051: she
 8052: appeared
 8053: but
 8054: she
 8055: ran
 8056: off
 8057: as
 8058: hard
 8059: as
 8060: she
 8061: could
 8062: and
 8063: soon
 8064: found
 8065: herself
 8066: safe
 8067: in
 8068: a
 8069: thick
 8070: wood
 8071: the
 8072: first
 8073: thing
 8074: i’ve
 8075: got
 8076: to
 8077: do
 8078: said
 8079: alice
 8080: to
 8081: herself
 8082: as
 8083: she
 8084: wandered
 8085: about
 8086: in
 8087: the
 8088: wood
 8089: is
 8090: to
 8091: grow
 8092: to
 8093: my
 8094: right
 8095: size
 8096: again
 8097: and
 8098: the
 8099: second
 8100: thing
 8101: is
 8102: to
 8103: find
 8104: my
 8105: way
 8106: into
 8107: that
 8108: lovely
 8109: garden
 8110: i
 8111: think
 8112: that
 8113: will
 8114: be
 8115: the
 8116: best
 8117: plan
 8118: it
 8119: sounded
 8120: an
 8121: excellent
 8122: plan
 8123: no
 8124: doubt
 8125: and
 8126: very
 8127: neatly
 8128: and
 8129: simply
 8130: arranged
 8131: the
 8132: only
 8133: difficulty
 8134: was
 8135: that
 8136: she
 8137: had
 8138: not
 8139: the
 8140: smallest
 8141: idea
 8142: how
 8143: to
 8144: set
 8145: about
 8146: it
 8147: and
 8148: while
 8149: she
 8150: was
 8151: peering
 8152: about
 8153: anxiously
 8154: among
 8155: the
 8156: trees
 8157: a
 8158: little
 8159: sharp
 8160: bark
 8161: just
 8162: over
 8163: her
 8164: head
 8165: made
 8166: her
 8167: look
 8168: up
 8169: in
 8170: a
 8171: great
 8172: hurry
 8173: an
 8174: enormous
 8175: puppy
 8176: was
 8177: looking
 8178: down
 8179: at
 8180: her
 8181: with
 8182: large
 8183: round
 8184: eyes
 8185: and
 8186: feebly
 8187: stretching
 8188: out
 8189: one
 8190: paw
 8191: trying
 8192: to
 8193: touch
 8194: her
 8195: poor
 8196: little
 8197: thing
 8198: said
 8199: alice
 8200: in
 8201: a
 8202: coaxing
 8203: tone
 8204: and
 8205: she
 8206: tried
 8207: hard
 8208: to
 8209: whistle
 8210: to
 8211: it
 8212: but
 8213: she
 8214: was
 8215: terribly
 8216: frightened
 8217: all
 8218: the
 8219: time
 8220: at
 8221: the
 8222: thought
 8223: that
 8224: it
 8225: might
 8226: be
 8227: hungry
 8228: in
 8229: which
 8230: case
 8231: it
 8232: would
 8233: be
 8234: very
 8235: likely
 8236: to
 8237: eat
 8238: her
 8239: up
 8240: in
 8241: spite
 8242: of
 8243: all
 8244: her
 8245: coaxing
 8246: hardly
 8247: knowing
 8248: what
 8249: she
 8250: did
 8251: she
 8252: picked
 8253: up
 8254: a
 8255: little
 8256: bit
 8257: of
 8258: stick
 8259: and
 8260: held
 8261: it
 8262: out
 8263: to
 8264: the
 8265: puppy
 8266: whereupon
 8267: the
 8268: puppy
 8269: jumped
 8270: into
 8271: the
 8272: air
 8273: off
 8274: all
 8275: its
 8276: feet
 8277: at
 8278: once
 8279: with
 8280: a
 8281: yelp
 8282: of
 8283: delight
 8284: and
 8285: rushed
 8286: at
 8287: the
 8288: stick
 8289: and
 8290: made
 8291: believe
 8292: to
 8293: worry
 8294: it
 8295: then
 8296: alice
 8297: dodged
 8298: behind
 8299: a
 8300: great
 8301: thistle
 8302: to
 8303: keep
 8304: herself
 8305: from
 8306: being
 8307: run
 8308: over
 8309: and
 8310: the
 8311: moment
 8312: she
 8313: appeared
 8314: on
 8315: the
 8316: other
 8317: side
 8318: the
 8319: puppy
 8320: made
 8321: another
 8322: rush
 8323: at
 8324: the
 8325: stick
 8326: and
 8327: tumbled
 8328: head
 8329: over
 8330: heels
 8331: in
 8332: its
 8333: hurry
 8334: to
 8335: get
 8336: hold
 8337: of
 8338: it
 8339: then
 8340: alice
 8341: thinking
 8342: it
 8343: was
 8344: very
 8345: like
 8346: having
 8347: a
 8348: game
 8349: of
 8350: play
 8351: with
 8352: a
 8353: cart-horse
 8354: and
 8355: expecting
 8356: every
 8357: moment
 8358: to
 8359: be
 8360: trampled
 8361: under
 8362: its
 8363: feet
 8364: ran
 8365: round
 8366: the
 8367: thistle
 8368: again
 8369: then
 8370: the
 8371: puppy
 8372: began
 8373: a
 8374: series
 8375: of
 8376: short
 8377: charges
 8378: at
 8379: the
 8380: stick
 8381: running
 8382: a
 8383: very
 8384: little
 8385: way
 8386: forwards
 8387: each
 8388: time
 8389: and
 8390: a
 8391: long
 8392: way
 8393: back
 8394: and
 8395: barking
 8396: hoarsely
 8397: all
 8398: the
 8399: while
 8400: till
 8401: at
 8402: last
 8403: it
 8404: sat
 8405: down
 8406: a
 8407: good
 8408: way
 8409: off
 8410: panting
 8411: with
 8412: its
 8413: tongue
 8414: hanging
 8415: out
 8416: of
 8417: its
 8418: mouth
 8419: and
 8420: its
 8421: great
 8422: eyes
 8423: half
 8424: shut
 8425: this
 8426: seemed
 8427: to
 8428: alice
 8429: a
 8430: good
 8431: opportunity
 8432: for
 8433: making
 8434: her
 8435: escape
 8436: so
 8437: she
 8438: set
 8439: off
 8440: at
 8441: once
 8442: and
 8443: ran
 8444: till
 8445: she
 8446: was
 8447: quite
 8448: tired
 8449: and
 8450: out
 8451: of
 8452: breath
 8453: and
 8454: till
 8455: the
 8456: puppy’s
 8457: bark
 8458: sounded
 8459: quite
 8460: faint
 8461: in
 8462: the
 8463: distance
 8464: and
 8465: yet
 8466: what
 8467: a
 8468: dear
 8469: little
 8470: puppy
 8471: it
 8472: was
 8473: said
 8474: alice
 8475: as
 8476: she
 8477: leant
 8478: against
 8479: a
 8480: buttercup
 8481: to
 8482: rest
 8483: herself
 8484: and
 8485: fanned
 8486: herself
 8487: with
 8488: one
 8489: of
 8490: the
 8491: leaves
 8492: i
 8493: should
 8494: have
 8495: liked
 8496: teaching
 8497: it
 8498: tricks
 8499: very
 8500: much
 8501: if—if
 8502: i’d
 8503: only
 8504: been
 8505: the
 8506: right
 8507: size
 8508: to
 8509: do
 8510: it
 8511: oh
 8512: dear
 8513: i’d
 8514: nearly
 8515: forgotten
 8516: that
 8517: i’ve
 8518: got
 8519: to
 8520: grow
 8521: up
 8522: again
 8523: let
 8524: me
 8525: see—how
 8526: is
 8527: it
 8528: to
 8529: be
 8530: managed
 8531: i
 8532: suppose
 8533: i
 8534: ought
 8535: to
 8536: eat
 8537: or
 8538: drink
 8539: something
 8540: or
 8541: other
 8542: but
 8543: the
 8544: great
 8545: question
 8546: is
 8547: what
 8548: the
 8549: great
 8550: question
 8551: certainly
 8552: was
 8553: what
 8554: alice
 8555: looked
 8556: all
 8557: round
 8558: her
 8559: at
 8560: the
 8561: flowers
 8562: and
 8563: the
 8564: blades
 8565: of
 8566: grass
 8567: but
 8568: she
 8569: did
 8570: not
 8571: see
 8572: anything
 8573: that
 8574: looked
 8575: like
 8576: the
 8577: right
 8578: thing
 8579: to
 8580: eat
 8581: or
 8582: drink
 8583: under
 8584: the
 8585: circumstances
 8586: there
 8587: was
 8588: a
 8589: large
 8590: mushroom
 8591: growing
 8592: near
 8593: her
 8594: about
 8595: the
 8596: same
 8597: height
 8598: as
 8599: herself
 8600: and
 8601: when
 8602: she
 8603: had
 8604: looked
 8605: under
 8606: it
 8607: and
 8608: on
 8609: both
 8610: sides
 8611: of
 8612: it
 8613: and
 8614: behind
 8615: it
 8616: it
 8617: occurred
 8618: to
 8619: her
 8620: that
 8621: she
 8622: might
 8623: as
 8624: well
 8625: look
 8626: and
 8627: see
 8628: what
 8629: was
 8630: on
 8631: the
 8632: top
 8633: of
 8634: it
 8635: she
 8636: stretched
 8637: herself
 8638: up
 8639: on
 8640: tiptoe
 8641: and
 8642: peeped
 8643: over
 8644: the
 8645: edge
 8646: of
 8647: the
 8648: mushroom
 8649: and
 8650: her
 8651: eyes
 8652: immediately
 8653: met
 8654: those
 8655: of
 8656: a
 8657: large
 8658: blue
 8659: caterpillar
 8660: that
 8661: was
 8662: sitting
 8663: on
 8664: the
 8665: top
 8666: with
 8667: its
 8668: arms
 8669: folded
 8670: quietly
 8671: smoking
 8672: a
 8673: long
 8674: hookah
 8675: and
 8676: taking
 8677: not
 8678: the
 8679: smallest
 8680: notice
 8681: of
 8682: her
 8683: or
 8684: of
 8685: anything
 8686: else
 8687: chapter
 8688: v
 8689: advice
 8690: from
 8691: a
 8692: caterpillar
 8693: the
 8694: caterpillar
 8695: and
 8696: alice
 8697: looked
 8698: at
 8699: each
 8700: other
 8701: for
 8702: some
 8703: time
 8704: in
 8705: silence
 8706: at
 8707: last
 8708: the
 8709: caterpillar
 8710: took
 8711: the
 8712: hookah
 8713: out
 8714: of
 8715: its
 8716: mouth
 8717: and
 8718: addressed
 8719: her
 8720: in
 8721: a
 8722: languid
 8723: sleepy
 8724: voice
 8725: who
 8726: are
 8727: you
 8728: said
 8729: the
 8730: caterpillar
 8731: this
 8732: was
 8733: not
 8734: an
 8735: encouraging
 8736: opening
 8737: for
 8738: a
 8739: conversation
 8740: alice
 8741: replied
 8742: rather
 8743: shyly
 8744: i—i
 8745: hardly
 8746: know
 8747: sir
 8748: just
 8749: at
 8750: present—at
 8751: least
 8752: i
 8753: know
 8754: who
 8755: i
 8756: was
 8757: when
 8758: i
 8759: got
 8760: up
 8761: this
 8762: morning
 8763: but
 8764: i
 8765: think
 8766: i
 8767: must
 8768: have
 8769: been
 8770: changed
 8771: several
 8772: times
 8773: since
 8774: then
 8775: what
 8776: do
 8777: you
 8778: mean
 8779: by
 8780: that
 8781: said
 8782: the
 8783: caterpillar
 8784: sternly
 8785: explain
 8786: yourself
 8787: i
 8788: can’t
 8789: explain
 8790: myself
 8791: i’m
 8792: afraid
 8793: sir
 8794: said
 8795: alice
 8796: because
 8797: i’m
 8798: not
 8799: myself
 8800: you
 8801: see
 8802: i
 8803: don’t
 8804: see
 8805: said
 8806: the
 8807: caterpillar
 8808: i’m
 8809: afraid
 8810: i
 8811: can’t
 8812: put
 8813: it
 8814: more
 8815: clearly
 8816: alice
 8817: replied
 8818: very
 8819: politely
 8820: for
 8821: i
 8822: can’t
 8823: understand
 8824: it
 8825: myself
 8826: to
 8827: begin
 8828: with
 8829: and
 8830: being
 8831: so
 8832: many
 8833: different
 8834: sizes
 8835: in
 8836: a
 8837: day
 8838: is
 8839: very
 8840: confusing
 8841: it
 8842: isn’t
 8843: said
 8844: the
 8845: caterpillar
 8846: well
 8847: perhaps
 8848: you
 8849: haven’t
 8850: found
 8851: it
 8852: so
 8853: yet
 8854: said
 8855: alice
 8856: but
 8857: when
 8858: you
 8859: have
 8860: to
 8861: turn
 8862: into
 8863: a
 8864: chrysalis—you
 8865: will
 8866: some
 8867: day
 8868: you
 8869: know—and
 8870: then
 8871: after
 8872: that
 8873: into
 8874: a
 8875: butterfly
 8876: i
 8877: should
 8878: think
 8879: you’ll
 8880: feel
 8881: it
 8882: a
 8883: little
 8884: queer
 8885: won’t
 8886: you
 8887: not
 8888: a
 8889: bit
 8890: said
 8891: the
 8892: caterpillar
 8893: well
 8894: perhaps
 8895: your
 8896: feelings
 8897: may
 8898: be
 8899: different
 8900: said
 8901: alice
 8902: all
 8903: i
 8904: know
 8905: is
 8906: it
 8907: would
 8908: feel
 8909: very
 8910: queer
 8911: to
 8912: me
 8913: you
 8914: said
 8915: the
 8916: caterpillar
 8917: contemptuously
 8918: who
 8919: are
 8920: you
 8921: which
 8922: brought
 8923: them
 8924: back
 8925: again
 8926: to
 8927: the
 8928: beginning
 8929: of
 8930: the
 8931: conversation
 8932: alice
 8933: felt
 8934: a
 8935: little
 8936: irritated
 8937: at
 8938: the
 8939: caterpillar’s
 8940: making
 8941: such
 8942: very
 8943: short
 8944: remarks
 8945: and
 8946: she
 8947: drew
 8948: herself
 8949: up
 8950: and
 8951: said
 8952: very
 8953: gravely
 8954: i
 8955: think
 8956: you
 8957: ought
 8958: to
 8959: tell
 8960: me
 8961: who
 8962: you
 8963: are
 8964: first
 8965: why
 8966: said
 8967: the
 8968: caterpillar
 8969: here
 8970: was
 8971: another
 8972: puzzling
 8973: question
 8974: and
 8975: as
 8976: alice
 8977: could
 8978: not
 8979: think
 8980: of
 8981: any
 8982: good
 8983: reason
 8984: and
 8985: as
 8986: the
 8987: caterpillar
 8988: seemed
 8989: to
 8990: be
 8991: in
 8992: a
 8993: very
 8994: unpleasant
 8995: state
 8996: of
 8997: mind
 8998: she
 8999: turned
 9000: away
 9001: come
 9002: back
 9003: the
 9004: caterpillar
 9005: called
 9006: after
 9007: her
 9008: i’ve
 9009: something
 9010: important
 9011: to
 9012: say
 9013: this
 9014: sounded
 9015: promising
 9016: certainly
 9017: alice
 9018: turned
 9019: and
 9020: came
 9021: back
 9022: again
 9023: keep
 9024: your
 9025: temper
 9026: said
 9027: the
 9028: caterpillar
 9029: is
 9030: that
 9031: all
 9032: said
 9033: alice
 9034: swallowing
 9035: down
 9036: her
 9037: anger
 9038: as
 9039: well
 9040: as
 9041: she
 9042: could
 9043: no
 9044: said
 9045: the
 9046: caterpillar
 9047: alice
 9048: thought
 9049: she
 9050: might
 9051: as
 9052: well
 9053: wait
 9054: as
 9055: she
 9056: had
 9057: nothing
 9058: else
 9059: to
 9060: do
 9061: and
 9062: perhaps
 9063: after
 9064: all
 9065: it
 9066: might
 9067: tell
 9068: her
 9069: something
 9070: worth
 9071: hearing
 9072: for
 9073: some
 9074: minutes
 9075: it
 9076: puffed
 9077: away
 9078: without
 9079: speaking
 9080: but
 9081: at
 9082: last
 9083: it
 9084: unfolded
 9085: its
 9086: arms
 9087: took
 9088: the
 9089: hookah
 9090: out
 9091: of
 9092: its
 9093: mouth
 9094: again
 9095: and
 9096: said
 9097: so
 9098: you
 9099: think
 9100: you’re
 9101: changed
 9102: do
 9103: you
 9104: i’m
 9105: afraid
 9106: i
 9107: am
 9108: sir
 9109: said
 9110: alice
 9111: i
 9112: can’t
 9113: remember
 9114: things
 9115: as
 9116: i
 9117: used—and
 9118: i
 9119: don’t
 9120: keep
 9121: the
 9122: same
 9123: size
 9124: for
 9125: ten
 9126: minutes
 9127: together
 9128: can’t
 9129: remember
 9130: what
 9131: things
 9132: said
 9133: the
 9134: caterpillar
 9135: well
 9136: i’ve
 9137: tried
 9138: to
 9139: say
 9140: how
 9141: doth
 9142: the
 9143: little
 9144: busy
 9145: bee
 9146: but
 9147: it
 9148: all
 9149: came
 9150: different
 9151: alice
 9152: replied
 9153: in
 9154: a
 9155: very
 9156: melancholy
 9157: voice
 9158: repeat
 9159: you
 9160: are
 9161: old
 9162: father
 9163: william
 9164: said
 9165: the
 9166: caterpillar
 9167: alice
 9168: folded
 9169: her
 9170: hands
 9171: and
 9172: began
 9173: you
 9174: are
 9175: old
 9176: father
 9177: william
 9178: the
 9179: young
 9180: man
 9181: said
 9182: and
 9183: your
 9184: hair
 9185: has
 9186: become
 9187: very
 9188: white
 9189: and
 9190: yet
 9191: you
 9192: incessantly
 9193: stand
 9194: on
 9195: your
 9196: head
 9197: do
 9198: you
 9199: think
 9200: at
 9201: your
 9202: age
 9203: it
 9204: is
 9205: right
 9206: in
 9207: my
 9208: youth
 9209: father
 9210: william
 9211: replied
 9212: to
 9213: his
 9214: son
 9215: i
 9216: feared
 9217: it
 9218: might
 9219: injure
 9220: the
 9221: brain
 9222: but
 9223: now
 9224: that
 9225: i’m
 9226: perfectly
 9227: sure
 9228: i
 9229: have
 9230: none
 9231: why
 9232: i
 9233: do
 9234: it
 9235: again
 9236: and
 9237: again
 9238: you
 9239: are
 9240: old
 9241: said
 9242: the
 9243: youth
 9244: as
 9245: i
 9246: mentioned
 9247: before
 9248: and
 9249: have
 9250: grown
 9251: most
 9252: uncommonly
 9253: fat
 9254: yet
 9255: you
 9256: turned
 9257: a
 9258: back-somersault
 9259: in
 9260: at
 9261: the
 9262: door
 9263: pray
 9264: what
 9265: is
 9266: the
 9267: reason
 9268: of
 9269: that
 9270: in
 9271: my
 9272: youth
 9273: said
 9274: the
 9275: sage
 9276: as
 9277: he
 9278: shook
 9279: his
 9280: grey
 9281: locks
 9282: i
 9283: kept
 9284: all
 9285: my
 9286: limbs
 9287: very
 9288: supple
 9289: by
 9290: the
 9291: use
 9292: of
 9293: this
 9294: ointment—one
 9295: shilling
 9296: the
 9297: box
 9298: allow
 9299: me
 9300: to
 9301: sell
 9302: you
 9303: a
 9304: couple
 9305: you
 9306: are
 9307: old
 9308: said
 9309: the
 9310: youth
 9311: and
 9312: your
 9313: jaws
 9314: are
 9315: too
 9316: weak
 9317: for
 9318: anything
 9319: tougher
 9320: than
 9321: suet
 9322: yet
 9323: you
 9324: finished
 9325: the
 9326: goose
 9327: with
 9328: the
 9329: bones
 9330: and
 9331: the
 9332: beak
 9333: pray
 9334: how
 9335: did
 9336: you
 9337: manage
 9338: to
 9339: do
 9340: it
 9341: in
 9342: my
 9343: youth
 9344: said
 9345: his
 9346: father
 9347: i
 9348: took
 9349: to
 9350: the
 9351: law
 9352: and
 9353: argued
 9354: each
 9355: case
 9356: with
 9357: my
 9358: wife
 9359: and
 9360: the
 9361: muscular
 9362: strength
 9363: which
 9364: it
 9365: gave
 9366: to
 9367: my
 9368: jaw
 9369: has
 9370: lasted
 9371: the
 9372: rest
 9373: of
 9374: my
 9375: life
 9376: you
 9377: are
 9378: old
 9379: said
 9380: the
 9381: youth
 9382: one
 9383: would
 9384: hardly
 9385: suppose
 9386: that
 9387: your
 9388: eye
 9389: was
 9390: as
 9391: steady
 9392: as
 9393: ever
 9394: yet
 9395: you
 9396: balanced
 9397: an
 9398: eel
 9399: on
 9400: the
 9401: end
 9402: of
 9403: your
 9404: nose
 9405: what
 9406: made
 9407: you
 9408: so
 9409: awfully
 9410: clever
 9411: i
 9412: have
 9413: answered
 9414: three
 9415: questions
 9416: and
 9417: that
 9418: is
 9419: enough
 9420: said
 9421: his
 9422: father
 9423: don’t
 9424: give
 9425: yourself
 9426: airs
 9427: do
 9428: you
 9429: think
 9430: i
 9431: can
 9432: listen
 9433: all
 9434: day
 9435: to
 9436: such
 9437: stuff
 9438: be
 9439: off
 9440: or
 9441: i’ll
 9442: kick
 9443: you
 9444: down
 9445: stairs
 9446: that
 9447: is
 9448: not
 9449: said
 9450: right
 9451: said
 9452: the
 9453: caterpillar
 9454: not
 9455: quite
 9456: right
 9457: i’m
 9458: afraid
 9459: said
 9460: alice
 9461: timidly
 9462: some
 9463: of
 9464: the
 9465: words
 9466: have
 9467: got
 9468: altered
 9469: it
 9470: is
 9471: wrong
 9472: from
 9473: beginning
 9474: to
 9475: end
 9476: said
 9477: the
 9478: caterpillar
 9479: decidedly
 9480: and
 9481: there
 9482: was
 9483: silence
 9484: for
 9485: some
 9486: minutes
 9487: the
 9488: caterpillar
 9489: was
 9490: the
 9491: first
 9492: to
 9493: speak
 9494: what
 9495: size
 9496: do
 9497: you
 9498: want
 9499: to
 9500: be
 9501: it
 9502: asked
 9503: oh
 9504: i’m
 9505: not
 9506: particular
 9507: as
 9508: to
 9509: size
 9510: alice
 9511: hastily
 9512: replied
 9513: only
 9514: one
 9515: doesn’t
 9516: like
 9517: changing
 9518: so
 9519: often
 9520: you
 9521: know
 9522: i
 9523: don’t
 9524: know
 9525: said
 9526: the
 9527: caterpillar
 9528: alice
 9529: said
 9530: nothing
 9531: she
 9532: had
 9533: never
 9534: been
 9535: so
 9536: much
 9537: contradicted
 9538: in
 9539: her
 9540: life
 9541: before
 9542: and
 9543: she
 9544: felt
 9545: that
 9546: she
 9547: was
 9548: losing
 9549: her
 9550: temper
 9551: are
 9552: you
 9553: content
 9554: now
 9555: said
 9556: the
 9557: caterpillar
 9558: well
 9559: i
 9560: should
 9561: like
 9562: to
 9563: be
 9564: a
 9565: little
 9566: larger
 9567: sir
 9568: if
 9569: you
 9570: wouldn’t
 9571: mind
 9572: said
 9573: alice
 9574: three
 9575: inches
 9576: is
 9577: such
 9578: a
 9579: wretched
 9580: height
 9581: to
 9582: be
 9583: it
 9584: is
 9585: a
 9586: very
 9587: good
 9588: height
 9589: indeed
 9590: said
 9591: the
 9592: caterpillar
 9593: angrily
 9594: rearing
 9595: itself
 9596: upright
 9597: as
 9598: it
 9599: spoke
 9600: it
 9601: was
 9602: exactly
 9603: three
 9604: inches
 9605: high
 9606: but
 9607: i’m
 9608: not
 9609: used
 9610: to
 9611: it
 9612: pleaded
 9613: poor
 9614: alice
 9615: in
 9616: a
 9617: piteous
 9618: tone
 9619: and
 9620: she
 9621: thought
 9622: of
 9623: herself
 9624: i
 9625: wish
 9626: the
 9627: creatures
 9628: wouldn’t
 9629: be
 9630: so
 9631: easily
 9632: offended
 9633: you’ll
 9634: get
 9635: used
 9636: to
 9637: it
 9638: in
 9639: time
 9640: said
 9641: the
 9642: caterpillar
 9643: and
 9644: it
 9645: put
 9646: the
 9647: hookah
 9648: into
 9649: its
 9650: mouth
 9651: and
 9652: began
 9653: smoking
 9654: again
 9655: this
 9656: time
 9657: alice
 9658: waited
 9659: patiently
 9660: until
 9661: it
 9662: chose
 9663: to
 9664: speak
 9665: again
 9666: in
 9667: a
 9668: minute
 9669: or
 9670: two
 9671: the
 9672: caterpillar
 9673: took
 9674: the
 9675: hookah
 9676: out
 9677: of
 9678: its
 9679: mouth
 9680: and
 9681: yawned
 9682: once
 9683: or
 9684: twice
 9685: and
 9686: shook
 9687: itself
 9688: then
 9689: it
 9690: got
 9691: down
 9692: off
 9693: the
 9694: mushroom
 9695: and
 9696: crawled
 9697: away
 9698: in
 9699: the
 9700: grass
 9701: merely
 9702: remarking
 9703: as
 9704: it
 9705: went
 9706: one
 9707: side
 9708: will
 9709: make
 9710: you
 9711: grow
 9712: taller
 9713: and
 9714: the
 9715: other
 9716: side
 9717: will
 9718: make
 9719: you
 9720: grow
 9721: shorter
 9722: one
 9723: side
 9724: of
 9725: what
 9726: the
 9727: other
 9728: side
 9729: of
 9730: what
 9731: thought
 9732: alice
 9733: to
 9734: herself
 9735: of
 9736: the
 9737: mushroom
 9738: said
 9739: the
 9740: caterpillar
 9741: just
 9742: as
 9743: if
 9744: she
 9745: had
 9746: asked
 9747: it
 9748: aloud
 9749: and
 9750: in
 9751: another
 9752: moment
 9753: it
 9754: was
 9755: out
 9756: of
 9757: sight
 9758: alice
 9759: remained
 9760: looking
 9761: thoughtfully
 9762: at
 9763: the
 9764: mushroom
 9765: for
 9766: a
 9767: minute
 9768: trying
 9769: to
 9770: make
 9771: out
 9772: which
 9773: were
 9774: the
 9775: two
 9776: sides
 9777: of
 9778: it
 9779: and
 9780: as
 9781: it
 9782: was
 9783: perfectly
 9784: round
 9785: she
 9786: found
 9787: this
 9788: a
 9789: very
 9790: difficult
 9791: question
 9792: however
 9793: at
 9794: last
 9795: she
 9796: stretched
 9797: her
 9798: arms
 9799: round
 9800: it
 9801: as
 9802: far
 9803: as
 9804: they
 9805: would
 9806: go
 9807: and
 9808: broke
 9809: off
 9810: a
 9811: bit
 9812: of
 9813: the
 9814: edge
 9815: with
 9816: each
 9817: hand
 9818: and
 9819: now
 9820: which
 9821: is
 9822: which
 9823: she
 9824: said
 9825: to
 9826: herself
 9827: and
 9828: nibbled
 9829: a
 9830: little
 9831: of
 9832: the
 9833: right-hand
 9834: bit
 9835: to
 9836: try
 9837: the
 9838: effect
 9839: the
 9840: next
 9841: moment
 9842: she
 9843: felt
 9844: a
 9845: violent
 9846: blow
 9847: underneath
 9848: her
 9849: chin
 9850: it
 9851: had
 9852: struck
 9853: her
 9854: foot
 9855: she
 9856: was
 9857: a
 9858: good
 9859: deal
 9860: frightened
 9861: by
 9862: this
 9863: very
 9864: sudden
 9865: change
 9866: but
 9867: she
 9868: felt
 9869: that
 9870: there
 9871: was
 9872: no
 9873: time
 9874: to
 9875: be
 9876: lost
 9877: as
 9878: she
 9879: was
 9880: shrinking
 9881: rapidly
 9882: so
 9883: she
 9884: set
 9885: to
 9886: work
 9887: at
 9888: once
 9889: to
 9890: eat
 9891: some
 9892: of
 9893: the
 9894: other
 9895: bit
 9896: her
 9897: chin
 9898: was
 9899: pressed
 9900: so
 9901: closely
 9902: against
 9903: her
 9904: foot
 9905: that
 9906: there
 9907: was
 9908: hardly
 9909: room
 9910: to
 9911: open
 9912: her
 9913: mouth
 9914: but
 9915: she
 9916: did
 9917: it
 9918: at
 9919: last
 9920: and
 9921: managed
 9922: to
 9923: swallow
 9924: a
 9925: morsel
 9926: of
 9927: the
 9928: lefthand

 9957: alice
 9958: in
 9959: a
 9960: tone
 9961: of
 9962: delight
 9963: which
 9964: changed
 9965: into
 9966: alarm
 9967: in
 9968: another
 9969: moment
 9970: when
 9971: she
 9972: found
 9973: that
 9974: her
 9975: shoulders
 9976: were
 9977: nowhere
 9978: to
 9979: be
 9980: found
 9981: all
 9982: she
 9983: could
 9984: see
 9985: when
 9986: she
 9987: looked
 9988: down
 9989: was
 9990: an
 9991: immense
 9992: length
 9993: of
 9994: neck
 9995: which
 9996: seemed
 9997: to
 9998: rise
 9999: like
10000: a
10001: stalk
10002: out
10003: of
10004: a
10005: sea
10006: of
10007: green
10008: leaves
10009: that
10010: lay
10011: far
10012: below
10013: her
10014: what
10015: can
10016: all
10017: that
10018: green
10019: stuff
10020: be
10021: said
10022: alice
10023: and
10024: where
10025: have
10026: my
10027: shoulders
10028: got
10029: to
10030: and
10031: oh
10032: my
10033: poor
10034: hands
10035: how
10036: is
10037: it
10038: i
10039: can’t
10040: see
10041: you
10042: she
10043: was
10044: moving
10045: them
10046: about
10047: as
10048: she
10049: spoke
10050: but
10051: no
10052: result
10053: seemed
10054: to
10055: follow
10056: except
10057: a
10058: little
10059: shaking
10060: among
10061: the
10062: distant
10063: green
10064: leaves
10065: as
10066: there
10067: seemed
10068: to
10069: be
10070: no
10071: chance
10072: of
10073: getting
10074: her
10075: hands
10076: up
10077: to
10078: her
10079: head
10080: she
10081: tried
10082: to
10083: get
10084: her
10085: head
10086: down
10087: to
10088: them
10089: and
10090: was
10091: delighted
10092: to
10093: find
10094: that
10095: her
10096: neck
10097: would
10098: bend
10099: about
10100: easily
10101: in
10102: any
10103: direction
10104: like
10105: a
10106: serpent
10107: she
10108: had
10109: just
10110: succeeded
10111: in
10112: curving
10113: it
10114: down
10115: into
10116: a
10117: graceful
10118: zigzag
10119: and
10120: was
10121: going
10122: to
10123: dive
10124: in
10125: among
10126: the
10127: leaves
10128: which
10129: she
10130: found
10131: to
10132: be
10133: nothing
10134: but
10135: the
10136: tops
10137: of
10138: the
10139: trees
10140: under
10141: which
10142: she
10143: had
10144: been
10145: wandering
10146: when
10147: a
10148: sharp
10149: hiss
10150: made
10151: her
10152: draw
10153: back
10154: in
10155: a
10156: hurry
10157: a
10158: large
10159: pigeon
10160: had
10161: flown
10162: into
10163: her
10164: face
10165: and
10166: was
10167: beating
10168: her
10169: violently
10170: with
10171: its
10172: wings
10173: serpent
10174: screamed
10175: the
10176: pigeon
10177: i’m
10178: not
10179: a
10180: serpent
10181: said
10182: alice
10183: indignantly
10184: let
10185: me
10186: alone
10187: serpent
10188: i
10189: say
10190: again
10191: repeated
10192: the
10193: pigeon
10194: but
10195: in
10196: a
10197: more
10198: subdued
10199: tone
10200: and
10201: added
10202: with
10203: a
10204: kind
10205: of
10206: sob
10207: i’ve
10208: tried
10209: every
10210: way
10211: and
10212: nothing
10213: seems
10214: to
10215: suit
10216: them
10217: i
10218: haven’t
10219: the
10220: least
10221: idea
10222: what
10223: you’re
10224: talking
10225: about
10226: said
10227: alice
10228: i’ve
10229: tried
10230: the
10231: roots
10232: of
10233: trees
10234: and
10235: i’ve
10236: tried
10237: banks
10238: and
10239: i’ve
10240: tried
10241: hedges
10242: the
10243: pigeon
10244: went
10245: on
10246: without
10247: attending
10248: to
10249: her
10250: but
10251: those
10252: serpents
10253: there’s
10254: no
10255: pleasing
10256: them
10257: alice
10258: was
10259: more
10260: and
10261: more
10262: puzzled
10263: but
10264: she
10265: thought
10266: there
10267: was
10268: no
10269: use
10270: in
10271: saying
10272: anything
10273: more
10274: till
10275: the
10276: pigeon
10277: had
10278: finished
10279: as
10280: if
10281: it
10282: wasn’t
10283: trouble
10284: enough
10285: hatching
10286: the
10287: eggs
10288: said
10289: the
10290: pigeon
10291: but
10292: i
10293: must
10294: be
10295: on
10296: the
10297: look-out
10298: for
10299: serpents
10300: night
10301: and
10302: day
10303: why
10304: i
10305: haven’t
10306: had
10307: a
10308: wink
10309: of
10310: sleep
10311: these
10312: three
10313: weeks
10314: i’m
10315: very
10316: sorry
10317: you’ve
10318: been
10319: annoyed
10320: said
10321: alice
10322: who
10323: was
10324: beginning
10325: to
10326: see
10327: its
10328: meaning
10329: and
10330: just
10331: as
10332: i’d
10333: taken
10334: the
10335: highest
10336: tree
10337: in
10338: the
10339: wood
10340: continued
10341: the
10342: pigeon
10343: raising
10344: its
10345: voice
10346: to
10347: a
10348: shriek
10349: and
10350: just
10351: as
10352: i
10353: was
10354: thinking
10355: i
10356: should
10357: be
10358: free
10359: of
10360: them
10361: at
10362: last
10363: they
10364: must
10365: needs
10366: come
10367: wriggling
10368: down
10369: from
10370: the
10371: sky
10372: ugh
10373: serpent
10374: but
10375: i’m
10376: not
10377: a
10378: serpent
10379: i
10380: tell
10381: you
10382: said
10383: alice
10384: i’m
10385: a—i’m
10386: a
10387: well
10388: what
10389: are
10390: you
10391: said
10392: the
10393: pigeon
10394: i
10395: can
10396: see
10397: you’re
10398: trying
10399: to
10400: invent
10401: something
10402: i—i’m
10403: a
10404: little
10405: girl
10406: said
10407: alice
10408: rather
10409: doubtfully
10410: as
10411: she
10412: remembered
10413: the
10414: number
10415: of
10416: changes
10417: she
10418: had
10419: gone
10420: through
10421: that
10422: day
10423: a
10424: likely
10425: story
10426: indeed
10427: said
10428: the
10429: pigeon
10430: in
10431: a
10432: tone
10433: of
10434: the
10435: deepest
10436: contempt
10437: i’ve
10438: seen
10439: a
10440: good
10441: many
10442: little
10443: girls
10444: in
10445: my
10446: time
10447: but
10448: never
10449: one
10450: with
10451: such
10452: a
10453: neck
10454: as
10455: that
10456: no
10457: no
10458: you’re
10459: a
10460: serpent
10461: and
10462: there’s
10463: no
10464: use
10465: denying
10466: it
10467: i
10468: suppose
10469: you’ll
10470: be
10471: telling
10472: me
10473: next
10474: that
10475: you
10476: never
10477: tasted
10478: an
10479: egg
10480: i
10481: have
10482: tasted
10483: eggs
10484: certainly
10485: said
10486: alice
10487: who
10488: was
10489: a
10490: very
10491: truthful
10492: child
10493: but
10494: little
10495: girls
10496: eat
10497: eggs
10498: quite
10499: as
10500: much
10501: as
10502: serpents
10503: do
10504: you
10505: know
10506: i
10507: don’t
10508: believe
10509: it
10510: said
10511: the
10512: pigeon
10513: but
10514: if
10515: they
10516: do
10517: why
10518: then
10519: they’re
10520: a
10521: kind
10522: of
10523: serpent
10524: that’s
10525: all
10526: i
10527: can
10528: say
10529: this
10530: was
10531: such
10532: a
10533: new
10534: idea
10535: to
10536: alice
10537: that
10538: she
10539: was
10540: quite
10541: silent
10542: for
10543: a
10544: minute
10545: or
10546: two
10547: which
10548: gave
10549: the
10550: pigeon
10551: the
10552: opportunity
10553: of
10554: adding
10555: you’re
10556: looking
10557: for
10558: eggs
10559: i
10560: know
10561: that
10562: well
10563: enough
10564: and
10565: what
10566: does
10567: it
10568: matter
10569: to
10570: me
10571: whether
10572: you’re
10573: a
10574: little
10575: girl
10576: or
10577: a
10578: serpent
10579: it
10580: matters
10581: a
10582: good
10583: deal
10584: to
10585: me
10586: said
10587: alice
10588: hastily
10589: but
10590: i’m
10591: not
10592: looking
10593: for
10594: eggs
10595: as
10596: it
10597: happens
10598: and
10599: if
10600: i
10601: was
10602: i
10603: shouldn’t
10604: want
10605: yours
10606: i
10607: don’t
10608: like
10609: them
10610: raw
10611: well
10612: be
10613: off
10614: then
10615: said
10616: the
10617: pigeon
10618: in
10619: a
10620: sulky
10621: tone
10622: as
10623: it
10624: settled
10625: down
10626: again
10627: into
10628: its
10629: nest
10630: alice
10631: crouched
10632: down
10633: among
10634: the
10635: trees
10636: as
10637: well
10638: as
10639: she
10640: could
10641: for
10642: her
10643: neck
10644: kept
10645: getting
10646: entangled
10647: among
10648: the
10649: branches
10650: and
10651: every
10652: now
10653: and
10654: then
10655: she
10656: had
10657: to
10658: stop
10659: and
10660: untwist
10661: it
10662: after
10663: a
10664: while
10665: she
10666: remembered
10667: that
10668: she
10669: still
10670: held
10671: the
10672: pieces
10673: of
10674: mushroom
10675: in
10676: her
10677: hands
10678: and
10679: she
10680: set
10681: to
10682: work
10683: very
10684: carefully
10685: nibbling
10686: first
10687: at
10688: one
10689: and
10690: then
10691: at
10692: the
10693: other
10694: and
10695: growing
10696: sometimes
10697: taller
10698: and
10699: sometimes
10700: shorter
10701: until
10702: she
10703: had
10704: succeeded
10705: in
10706: bringing
10707: herself
10708: down
10709: to
10710: her
10711: usual
10712: height
10713: it
10714: was
10715: so
10716: long
10717: since
10718: she
10719: had
10720: been
10721: anything
10722: near
10723: the
10724: right
10725: size
10726: that
10727: it
10728: felt
10729: quite
10730: strange
10731: at
10732: first
10733: but
10734: she
10735: got
10736: used
10737: to
10738: it
10739: in
10740: a
10741: few
10742: minutes
10743: and
10744: began
10745: talking
10746: to
10747: herself
10748: as
10749: usual
10750: come
10751: there’s
10752: half
10753: my
10754: plan
10755: done
10756: now
10757: how
10758: puzzling
10759: all
10760: these
10761: changes
10762: are
10763: i’m
10764: never
10765: sure
10766: what
10767: i’m
10768: going
10769: to
10770: be
10771: from
10772: one
10773: minute
10774: to
10775: another
10776: however
10777: i’ve
10778: got
10779: back
10780: to
10781: my
10782: right
10783: size
10784: the
10785: next
10786: thing
10787: is
10788: to
10789: get
10790: into
10791: that
10792: beautiful
10793: garden—how
10794: is
10795: that
10796: to
10797: be
10798: done
10799: i
10800: wonder
10801: as
10802: she
10803: said
10804: this
10805: she
10806: came
10807: suddenly
10808: upon
10809: an
10810: open
10811: place
10812: with
10813: a
10814: little
10815: house
10816: in
10817: it
10818: about
10819: four
10820: feet
10821: high
10822: whoever
10823: lives
10824: there
10825: thought
10826: alice
10827: it’ll
10828: never
10829: do
10830: to
10831: come
10832: upon
10833: them
10834: this
10835: size
10836: why
10837: i
10838: should
10839: frighten
10840: them
10841: out
10842: of
10843: their
10844: wits
10845: so
10846: she
10847: began
10848: nibbling
10849: at
10850: the
10851: righthand
10852: bit
10853: again
10854: and
10855: did
10856: not
10857: venture
10858: to
10859: go
10860: near
10861: the
10862: house
10863: till
10864: she
10865: had
10866: brought
10867: herself
10868: down
10869: to
10870: nine
10871: inches
10872: high
10873: chapter
10874: vi
10875: pig
10876: and
10877: pepper
10878: for
10879: a
10880: minute
10881: or
10882: two
10883: she
10884: stood
10885: looking
10886: at
10887: the
10888: house
10889: and
10890: wondering
10891: what
10892: to
10893: do
10894: next
10895: when
10896: suddenly
10897: a
10898: footman
10899: in
10900: livery
10901: came
10902: running
10903: out
10904: of
10905: the
10906: wood—(she
10907: considered
10908: him
10909: to
10910: be
10911: a
10912: footman
10913: because
10914: he
10915: was
10916: in
10917: livery
10918: otherwise
10919: judging
10920: by
10921: his
10922: face
10923: only
10924: she
10925: would
10926: have
10927: called
10928: him
10929: a
10930: fish)—and
10931: rapped
10932: loudly
10933: at
10934: the
10935: door
10936: with
10937: his
10938: knuckles
10939: it
10940: was
10941: opened
10942: by
10943: another
10944: footman
10945: in
10946: livery
10947: with
10948: a
10949: round
10950: face
10951: and
10952: large
10953: eyes
10954: like
10955: a
10956: frog
10957: and
10958: both
10959: footmen
10960: alice
10961: noticed
10962: had
10963: powdered
10964: hair
10965: that
10966: curled
10967: all
10968: over
10969: their
10970: heads
10971: she
10972: felt
10973: very
10974: curious
10975: to
10976: know
10977: what
10978: it
10979: was
10980: all
10981: about
10982: and
10983: crept
10984: a
10985: little
10986: way
10987: out
10988: of
10989: the
10990: wood
10991: to
10992: listen
10993: the
10994: fish-footman
10995: began
10996: by
10997: producing
10998: from
10999: under
11000: his
11001: arm
11002: a
11003: great
11004: letter
11005: nearly
11006: as
11007: large
11008: as
11009: himself
11010: and
11011: this
11012: he
11013: handed
11014: over
11015: to
11016: the
11017: other
11018: saying
11019: in
11020: a
11021: solemn
11022: tone
11023: for
11024: the
11025: duchess
11026: an
11027: invitation
11028: from
11029: the
11030: queen
11031: to
11032: play
11033: croquet
11034: the
11035: frog-footman
11036: repeated
11037: in
11038: the
11039: same
11040: solemn
11041: tone
11042: only
11043: changing
11044: the
11045: order
11046: of
11047: the
11048: words
11049: a
11050: little
11051: from
11052: the
11053: queen
11054: an
11055: invitation
11056: for
11057: the
11058: duchess
11059: to
11060: play
11061: croquet
11062: then
11063: they
11064: both
11065: bowed
11066: low
11067: and
11068: their
11069: curls
11070: got
11071: entangled
11072: together
11073: alice
11074: laughed
11075: so
11076: much
11077: at
11078: this
11079: that
11080: she
11081: had
11082: to
11083: run
11084: back
11085: into
11086: the
11087: wood
11088: for
11089: fear
11090: of
11091: their
11092: hearing
11093: her
11094: and
11095: when
11096: she
11097: next
11098: peeped
11099: out
11100: the
11101: fish-footman
11102: was
11103: gone
11104: and
11105: the
11106: other
11107: was
11108: sitting
11109: on
11110: the
11111: ground
11112: near
11113: the
11114: door
11115: staring
11116: stupidly
11117: up
11118: into
11119: the
11120: sky
11121: alice
11122: went
11123: timidly
11124: up
11125: to
11126: the
11127: door
11128: and
11129: knocked
11130: there’s
11131: no
11132: sort
11133: of
11134: use
11135: in
11136: knocking
11137: said
11138: the
11139: footman
11140: and
11141: that
11142: for
11143: two
11144: reasons
11145: first
11146: because
11147: i’m
11148: on
11149: the
11150: same
11151: side
11152: of
11153: the
11154: door
11155: as
11156: you
11157: are
11158: secondly
11159: because
11160: they’re
11161: making
11162: such
11163: a
11164: noise
11165: inside
11166: no
11167: one
11168: could
11169: possibly
11170: hear
11171: you
11172: and
11173: certainly
11174: there
11175: was
11176: a
11177: most
11178: extraordinary
11179: noise
11180: going
11181: on
11182: within—a
11183: constant
11184: howling
11185: and
11186: sneezing
11187: and
11188: every
11189: now
11190: and
11191: then
11192: a
11193: great
11194: crash
11195: as
11196: if
11197: a
11198: dish
11199: or
11200: kettle
11201: had
11202: been
11203: broken
11204: to
11205: pieces
11206: please
11207: then
11208: said
11209: alice
11210: how
11211: am
11212: i
11213: to
11214: get
11215: in
11216: there
11217: might
11218: be
11219: some
11220: sense
11221: in
11222: your
11223: knocking
11224: the
11225: footman
11226: went
11227: on
11228: without
11229: attending
11230: to
11231: her
11232: if
11233: we
11234: had
11235: the
11236: door
11237: between
11238: us
11239: for
11240: instance
11241: if
11242: you
11243: were
11244: inside
11245: you
11246: might
11247: knock
11248: and
11249: i
11250: could
11251: let
11252: you
11253: out
11254: you
11255: know
11256: he
11257: was
11258: looking
11259: up
11260: into
11261: the
11262: sky
11263: all
11264: the
11265: time
11266: he
11267: was
11268: speaking
11269: and
11270: this
11271: alice
11272: thought
11273: decidedly
11274: uncivil
11275: but
11276: perhaps
11277: he
11278: can’t
11279: help
11280: it
11281: she
11282: said
11283: to
11284: herself
11285: his
11286: eyes
11287: are
11288: so
11289: very
11290: nearly
11291: at
11292: the
11293: top
11294: of
11295: his
11296: head
11297: but
11298: at
11299: any
11300: rate
11301: he
11302: might
11303: answer
11304: questions.—how
11305: am
11306: i
11307: to
11308: get
11309: in
11310: she
11311: repeated
11312: aloud
11313: i
11314: shall
11315: sit
11316: here
11317: the
11318: footman
11319: remarked
11320: till
11321: tomorrow
11322: at
11323: this
11324: moment
11325: the
11326: door
11327: of
11328: the
11329: house
11330: opened
11331: and
11332: a
11333: large
11334: plate
11335: came
11336: skimming
11337: out
11338: straight
11339: at
11340: the
11341: footman’s
11342: head
11343: it
11344: just
11345: grazed
11346: his
11347: nose
11348: and
11349: broke
11350: to
11351: pieces
11352: against
11353: one
11354: of
11355: the
11356: trees
11357: behind
11358: him
11359: or
11360: next
11361: day
11362: maybe
11363: the
11364: footman
11365: continued
11366: in
11367: the
11368: same
11369: tone
11370: exactly
11371: as
11372: if
11373: nothing
11374: had
11375: happened
11376: how
11377: am
11378: i
11379: to
11380: get
11381: in
11382: asked
11383: alice
11384: again
11385: in
11386: a
11387: louder
11388: tone
11389: are
11390: you
11391: to
11392: get
11393: in
11394: at
11395: all
11396: said
11397: the
11398: footman
11399: that’s
11400: the
11401: first
11402: question
11403: you
11404: know
11405: it
11406: was
11407: no
11408: doubt
11409: only
11410: alice
11411: did
11412: not
11413: like
11414: to
11415: be
11416: told
11417: so
11418: it’s
11419: really
11420: dreadful
11421: she
11422: muttered
11423: to
11424: herself
11425: the
11426: way
11427: all
11428: the
11429: creatures
11430: argue
11431: it’s
11432: enough
11433: to
11434: drive
11435: one
11436: crazy
11437: the
11438: footman
11439: seemed
11440: to
11441: think
11442: this
11443: a
11444: good
11445: opportunity
11446: for
11447: repeating
11448: his
11449: remark
11450: with
11451: variations
11452: i
11453: shall
11454: sit
11455: here
11456: he
11457: said
11458: on
11459: and
11460: off
11461: for
11462: days
11463: and
11464: days
11465: but
11466: what
11467: am
11468: i
11469: to
11470: do
11471: said
11472: alice
11473: anything
11474: you
11475: like
11476: said
11477: the
11478: footman
11479: and
11480: began
11481: whistling
11482: oh
11483: there’s
11484: no
11485: use
11486: in
11487: talking
11488: to
11489: him
11490: said
11491: alice
11492: desperately
11493: he’s
11494: perfectly
11495: idiotic
11496: and
11497: she
11498: opened
11499: the
11500: door
11501: and
11502: went
11503: in
11504: the
11505: door
11506: led
11507: right
11508: into
11509: a
11510: large
11511: kitchen
11512: which
11513: was
11514: full
11515: of
11516: smoke
11517: from
11518: one
11519: end
11520: to
11521: the
11522: other
11523: the
11524: duchess
11525: was
11526: sitting
11527: on
11528: a
11529: three-legged
11530: stool
11531: in
11532: the
11533: middle
11534: nursing
11535: a
11536: baby
11537: the
11538: cook
11539: was
11540: leaning
11541: over
11542: the
11543: fire
11544: stirring
11545: a
11546: large
11547: cauldron
11548: which
11549: seemed
11550: to
11551: be
11552: full
11553: of
11554: soup
11555: there’s
11556: certainly
11557: too
11558: much
11559: pepper
11560: in
11561: that
11562: soup
11563: alice
11564: said
11565: to
11566: herself
11567: as
11568: well
11569: as
11570: she
11571: could
11572: for
11573: sneezing
11574: there
11575: was
11576: certainly
11577: too
11578: much
11579: of
11580: it
11581: in
11582: the
11583: air
11584: even
11585: the
11586: duchess
11587: sneezed
11588: occasionally
11589: and
11590: as
11591: for
11592: the
11593: baby
11594: it
11595: was
11596: sneezing
11597: and
11598: howling
11599: alternately
11600: without
11601: a
11602: moment’s
11603: pause
11604: the
11605: only
11606: things
11607: in
11608: the
11609: kitchen
11610: that
11611: did
11612: not
11613: sneeze
11614: were
11615: the
11616: cook
11617: and
11618: a
11619: large
11620: cat
11621: which
11622: was
11623: sitting
11624: on
11625: the
11626: hearth
11627: and
11628: grinning
11629: from
11630: ear
11631: to
11632: ear
11633: please
11634: would
11635: you
11636: tell
11637: me
11638: said
11639: alice
11640: a
11641: little
11642: timidly
11643: for
11644: she
11645: was
11646: not
11647: quite
11648: sure
11649: whether
11650: it
11651: was
11652: good
11653: manners
11654: for
11655: her
11656: to
11657: speak
11658: first
11659: why
11660: your
11661: cat
11662: grins
11663: like
11664: that
11665: it’s
11666: a
11667: cheshire
11668: cat
11669: said
11670: the
11671: duchess
11672: and
11673: that’s
11674: why
11675: pig
11676: she
11677: said
11678: the
11679: last
11680: word
11681: with
11682: such
11683: sudden
11684: violence
11685: that
11686: alice
11687: quite
11688: jumped
11689: but
11690: she
11691: saw
11692: in
11693: another
11694: moment
11695: that
11696: it
11697: was
11698: addressed
11699: to
11700: the
11701: baby
11702: and
11703: not
11704: to
11705: her
11706: so
11707: she
11708: took
11709: courage
11710: and
11711: went
11712: on
11713: again
11714: i
11715: didn’t
11716: know
11717: that
11718: cheshire
11719: cats
11720: always
11721: grinned
11722: in
11723: fact
11724: i
11725: didn’t
11726: know
11727: that
11728: cats
11729: could
11730: grin
11731: they
11732: all
11733: can
11734: said
11735: the
11736: duchess
11737: and
11738: most
11739: of
11740: em
11741: do
11742: i
11743: don’t
11744: know
11745: of
11746: any
11747: that
11748: do
11749: alice
11750: said
11751: very
11752: politely
11753: feeling
11754: quite
11755: pleased
11756: to
11757: have
11758: got
11759: into
11760: a
11761: conversation
11762: you
11763: don’t
11764: know
11765: much
11766: said
11767: the
11768: duchess
11769: and
11770: that’s
11771: a
11772: fact
11773: alice
11774: did
11775: not
11776: at
11777: all
11778: like
11779: the
11780: tone
11781: of
11782: this
11783: remark
11784: and
11785: thought
11786: it
11787: would
11788: be
11789: as
11790: well
11791: to
11792: introduce
11793: some
11794: other
11795: subject
11796: of
11797: conversation
11798: while
11799: she
11800: was
11801: trying
11802: to
11803: fix
11804: on
11805: one
11806: the
11807: cook
11808: took
11809: the
11810: cauldron
11811: of
11812: soup
11813: off
11814: the
11815: fire
11816: and
11817: at
11818: once
11819: set
11820: to
11821: work
11822: throwing
11823: everything
11824: within
11825: her
11826: reach
11827: at
11828: the
11829: duchess
11830: and
11831: the
11832: baby—the
11833: fire-irons
11834: came
11835: first
11836: then
11837: followed
11838: a
11839: shower
11840: of
11841: saucepans
11842: plates
11843: and
11844: dishes
11845: the
11846: duchess
11847: took
11848: no
11849: notice
11850: of
11851: them
11852: even
11853: when
11854: they
11855: hit
11856: her
11857: and
11858: the
11859: baby
11860: was
11861: howling
11862: so
11863: much
11864: already
11865: that
11866: it
11867: was
11868: quite
11869: impossible
11870: to
11871: say
11872: whether
11873: the
11874: blows
11875: hurt
11876: it
11877: or
11878: not
11879: oh
11880: please
11881: mind
11882: what
11883: you’re
11884: doing
11885: cried
11886: alice
11887: jumping
11888: up
11889: and
11890: down
11891: in
11892: an
11893: agony
11894: of
11895: terror
11896: oh
11897: there
11898: goes
11899: his
11900: precious
11901: nose
11902: as
11903: an
11904: unusually
11905: large
11906: saucepan
11907: flew
11908: close
11909: by
11910: it
11911: and
11912: very
11913: nearly
11914: carried
11915: it
11916: off
11917: if
11918: everybody
11919: minded
11920: their
11921: own
11922: business
11923: the
11924: duchess
11925: said
11926: in
11927: a
11928: hoarse
11929: growl
11930: the
11931: world
11932: would
11933: go
11934: round
11935: a
11936: deal
11937: faster
11938: than
11939: it
11940: does
11941: which
11942: would
11943: not
11944: be
11945: an
11946: advantage
11947: said
11948: alice
11949: who
11950: felt
11951: very
11952: glad
11953: to
11954: get
11955: an
11956: opportunity
11957: of
11958: showing
11959: off
11960: a
11961: little
11962: of
11963: her
11964: knowledge
11965: just
11966: think
11967: of
11968: what
11969: work
11970: it
11971: would
11972: make
11973: with
11974: the
11975: day
11976: and
11977: night
11978: you
11979: see
11980: the
11981: earth
11982: takes
11983: twenty-four
11984: hours
11985: to
11986: turn
11987: round
11988: on
11989: its
11990: axis
11991: talking
11992: of
11993: axes
11994: said
11995: the
11996: duchess
11997: chop
11998: off
11999: her
12000: head
12001: alice
12002: glanced
12003: rather
12004: anxiously
12005: at
12006: the
12007: cook
12008: to
12009: see
12010: if
12011: she
12012: meant
12013: to
12014: take
12015: the
12016: hint
12017: but
12018: the
12019: cook
12020: was
12021: busily
12022: stirring
12023: the
12024: soup
12025: and
12026: seemed
12027: not
12028: to
12029: be
12030: listening
12031: so
12032: she
12033: went
12034: on
12035: again
12036: twenty-four
12037: hours
12038: i
12039: think
12040: or
12041: is
12042: it
12043: twelve
12044: i
12045: oh
12046: don’t
12047: bother
12048: me
12049: said
12050: the
12051: duchess
12052: i
12053: never
12054: could
12055: abide
12056: figures
12057: and
12058: with
12059: that
12060: she
12061: began
12062: nursing
12063: her
12064: child
12065: again
12066: singing
12067: a
12068: sort
12069: of
12070: lullaby
12071: to
12072: it
12073: as
12074: she
12075: did
12076: so
12077: and
12078: giving
12079: it
12080: a
12081: violent
12082: shake
12083: at
12084: the
12085: end
12086: of
12087: every
12088: line
12089: speak
12090: roughly
12091: to
12092: your
12093: little
12094: boy
12095: and
12096: beat
12097: him
12098: when
12099: he
12100: sneezes
12101: he
12102: only
12103: does
12104: it
12105: to
12106: annoy
12107: because
12108: he
12109: knows
12110: it
12111: teases
12112: chorus
12113: in
12114: which
12115: the
12116: cook
12117: and
12118: the
12119: baby
12120: joined
12121: wow
12122: wow
12123: wow
12124: while
12125: the
12126: duchess
12127: sang
12128: the
12129: second
12130: verse
12131: of
12132: the
12133: song
12134: she
12135: kept
12136: tossing
12137: the
12138: baby
12139: violently
12140: up
12141: and
12142: down
12143: and
12144: the
12145: poor
12146: little
12147: thing
12148: howled
12149: so
12150: that
12151: alice
12152: could
12153: hardly
12154: hear
12155: the
12156: words
12157: i
12158: speak
12159: severely
12160: to
12161: my
12162: boy
12163: i
12164: beat
12165: him
12166: when
12167: he
12168: sneezes
12169: for
12170: he
12171: can
12172: thoroughly
12173: enjoy
12174: the
12175: pepper
12176: when
12177: he
12178: pleases
12179: chorus
12180: wow
12181: wow
12182: wow
12183: here
12184: you
12185: may
12186: nurse
12187: it
12188: a
12189: bit
12190: if
12191: you
12192: like
12193: the
12194: duchess
12195: said
12196: to
12197: alice
12198: flinging
12199: the
12200: baby
12201: at
12202: her
12203: as
12204: she
12205: spoke
12206: i
12207: must
12208: go
12209: and
12210: get
12211: ready
12212: to
12213: play
12214: croquet
12215: with
12216: the
12217: queen
12218: and
12219: she
12220: hurried
12221: out
12222: of
12223: the
12224: room
12225: the
12226: cook
12227: threw
12228: a
12229: frying-pan
12230: after
12231: her
12232: as
12233: she
12234: went
12235: out
12236: but
12237: it
12238: just
12239: missed
12240: her
12241: alice
12242: caught
12243: the
12244: baby
12245: with
12246: some
12247: difficulty
12248: as
12249: it
12250: was
12251: a
12252: queer-shaped
12253: little
12254: creature
12255: and
12256: held
12257: out
12258: its
12259: arms
12260: and
12261: legs
12262: in
12263: all
12264: directions
12265: just
12266: like
12267: a
12268: star-fish
12269: thought
12270: alice
12271: the
12272: poor
12273: little
12274: thing
12275: was
12276: snorting
12277: like
12278: a
12279: steam-engine
12280: when
12281: she
12282: caught
12283: it
12284: and
12285: kept
12286: doubling
12287: itself
12288: up
12289: and
12290: straightening
12291: itself
12292: out
12293: again
12294: so
12295: that
12296: altogether
12297: for
12298: the
12299: first
12300: minute
12301: or
12302: two
12303: it
12304: was
12305: as
12306: much
12307: as
12308: she
12309: could
12310: do
12311: to
12312: hold
12313: it
12314: as
12315: soon
12316: as
12317: she
12318: had
12319: made
12320: out
12321: the
12322: proper
12323: way
12324: of
12325: nursing
12326: it
12327: which
12328: was
12329: to
12330: twist
12331: it
12332: up
12333: into
12334: a
12335: sort
12336: of
12337: knot
12338: and
12339: then
12340: keep
12341: tight
12342: hold
12343: of
12344: its
12345: right
12346: ear
12347: and
12348: left
12349: foot
12350: so
12351: as
12352: to
12353: prevent
12354: its
12355: undoing
12356: itself
12357: she
12358: carried
12359: it
12360: out
12361: into
12362: the
12363: open
12364: air
12365: if
12366: i
12367: don’t
12368: take
12369: this
12370: child
12371: away
12372: with
12373: me
12374: thought
12375: alice
12376: they’re
12377: sure
12378: to
12379: kill
12380: it
12381: in
12382: a
12383: day
12384: or
12385: two
12386: wouldn’t
12387: it
12388: be
12389: murder
12390: to
12391: leave
12392: it
12393: behind
12394: she
12395: said
12396: the
12397: last
12398: words
12399: out
12400: loud
12401: and
12402: the
12403: little
12404: thing
12405: grunted
12406: in
12407: reply
12408: it
12409: had
12410: left
12411: off
12412: sneezing
12413: by
12414: this
12415: time
12416: don’t
12417: grunt
12418: said
12419: alice
12420: that’s
12421: not
12422: at
12423: all
12424: a
12425: proper
12426: way
12427: of
12428: expressing
12429: yourself
12430: the
12431: baby
12432: grunted
12433: again
12434: and
12435: alice
12436: looked
12437: very
12438: anxiously
12439: into
12440: its
12441: face
12442: to
12443: see
12444: what
12445: was
12446: the
12447: matter
12448: with
12449: it
12450: there
12451: could
12452: be
12453: no
12454: doubt
12455: that
12456: it
12457: had
12458: a
12459: very
12460: turn-up
12461: nose
12462: much
12463: more
12464: like
12465: a
12466: snout
12467: than
12468: a
12469: real
12470: nose
12471: also
12472: its
12473: eyes
12474: were
12475: getting
12476: extremely
12477: small
12478: for
12479: a
12480: baby
12481: altogether
12482: alice
12483: did
12484: not
12485: like
12486: the
12487: look
12488: of
12489: the
12490: thing
12491: at
12492: all
12493: but
12494: perhaps
12495: it
12496: was
12497: only
12498: sobbing
12499: she
12500: thought
12501: and
12502: looked
12503: into
12504: its
12505: eyes
12506: again
12507: to
12508: see
12509: if
12510: there
12511: were
12512: any
12513: tears
12514: no
12515: there
12516: were
12517: no
12518: tears
12519: if
12520: you’re
12521: going
12522: to
12523: turn
12524: into
12525: a
12526: pig
12527: my
12528: dear
12529: said
12530: alice
12531: seriously
12532: i’ll
12533: have
12534: nothing
12535: more
12536: to
12537: do
12538: with
12539: you
12540: mind
12541: now
12542: the
12543: poor
12544: little
12545: thing
12546: sobbed
12547: again
12548: or
12549: grunted
12550: it
12551: was
12552: impossible
12553: to
12554: say
12555: which
12556: and
12557: they
12558: went
12559: on
12560: for
12561: some
12562: while
12563: in
12564: silence
12565: alice
12566: was
12567: just
12568: beginning
12569: to
12570: think
12571: to
12572: herself
12573: now
12574: what
12575: am
12576: i
12577: to
12578: do
12579: with
12580: this
12581: creature
12582: when
12583: i
12584: get
12585: it
12586: home
12587: when
12588: it
12589: grunted
12590: again
12591: so
12592: violently
12593: that
12594: she
12595: looked
12596: down
12597: into
12598: its
12599: face
12600: in
12601: some
12602: alarm
12603: this
12604: time
12605: there
12606: could
12607: be
12608: no
12609: mistake
12610: about
12611: it
12612: it
12613: was
12614: neither
12615: more
12616: nor
12617: less
12618: than
12619: a
12620: pig
12621: and
12622: she
12623: felt
12624: that
12625: it
12626: would
12627: be
12628: quite
12629: absurd
12630: for
12631: her
12632: to
12633: carry
12634: it
12635: further
12636: so
12637: she
12638: set
12639: the
12640: little
12641: creature
12642: down
12643: and
12644: felt
12645: quite
12646: relieved
12647: to
12648: see
12649: it
12650: trot
12651: away
12652: quietly
12653: into
12654: the
12655: wood
12656: if
12657: it
12658: had
12659: grown
12660: up
12661: she
12662: said
12663: to
12664: herself
12665: it
12666: would
12667: have
12668: made
12669: a
12670: dreadfully
12671: ugly
12672: child
12673: but
12674: it
12675: makes
12676: rather
12677: a
12678: handsome
12679: pig
12680: i
12681: think
12682: and
12683: she
12684: began
12685: thinking
12686: over
12687: other
12688: children
12689: she
12690: knew
12691: who
12692: might
12693: do
12694: very
12695: well
12696: as
12697: pigs
12698: and
12699: was
12700: just
12701: saying
12702: to
12703: herself
12704: if
12705: one
12706: only
12707: knew
12708: the
12709: right
12710: way
12711: to
12712: change
12713: them
12714: when
12715: she
12716: was
12717: a
12718: little
12719: startled
12720: by
12721: seeing
12722: the
12723: cheshire
12724: cat
12725: sitting
12726: on
12727: a
12728: bough
12729: of
12730: a
12731: tree
12732: a
12733: few
12734: yards
12735: off
12736: the
12737: cat
12738: only
12739: grinned
12740: when
12741: it
12742: saw
12743: alice
12744: it
12745: looked
12746: good-natured
12747: she
12748: thought
12749: still
12750: it
12751: had
12752: very
12753: long
12754: claws
12755: and
12756: a
12757: great
12758: many
12759: teeth
12760: so
12761: she
12762: felt
12763: that
12764: it
12765: ought
12766: to
12767: be
12768: treated
12769: with
12770: respect
12771: cheshire
12772: puss
12773: she
12774: began
12775: rather
12776: timidly
12777: as
12778: she
12779: did
12780: not
12781: at
12782: all
12783: know
12784: whether
12785: it
12786: would
12787: like
12788: the
12789: name
12790: however
12791: it
12792: only
12793: grinned
12794: a
12795: little
12796: wider
12797: come
12798: it’s
12799: pleased
12800: so
12801: far
12802: thought
12803: alice
12804: and
12805: she
12806: went
12807: on
12808: would
12809: you
12810: tell
12811: me
12812: please
12813: which
12814: way
12815: i
12816: ought
12817: to
12818: go
12819: from
12820: here
12821: that
12822: depends
12823: a
12824: good
12825: deal
12826: on
12827: where
12828: you
12829: want
12830: to
12831: get
12832: to
12833: said
12834: the
12835: cat
12836: i
12837: don’t
12838: much
12839: care
12840: where
12841: said
12842: alice
12843: then
12844: it
12845: doesn’t
12846: matter
12847: which
12848: way
12849: you
12850: go
12851: said
12852: the
12853: cat
12854: so
12855: long
12856: as
12857: i
12858: get
12859: somewhere
12860: alice
12861: added
12862: as
12863: an
12864: explanation
12865: oh
12866: you’re
12867: sure
12868: to
12869: do
12870: that
12871: said
12872: the
12873: cat
12874: if
12875: you
12876: only
12877: walk
12878: long
12879: enough
12880: alice
12881: felt
12882: that
12883: this
12884: could
12885: not
12886: be
12887: denied
12888: so
12889: she
12890: tried
12891: another
12892: question
12893: what
12894: sort
12895: of
12896: people
12897: live
12898: about
12899: here
12900: in
12901: that
12902: direction
12903: the
12904: cat
12905: said
12906: waving
12907: its
12908: right
12909: paw
12910: round
12911: lives
12912: a
12913: hatter
12914: and
12915: in
12916: that
12917: direction
12918: waving
12919: the
12920: other
12921: paw
12922: lives
12923: a
12924: march
12925: hare
12926: visit
12927: either
12928: you
12929: like
12930: they’re
12931: both
12932: mad
12933: but
12934: i
12935: don’t
12936: want
12937: to
12938: go
12939: among
12940: mad
12941: people
12942: alice
12943: remarked
12944: oh
12945: you
12946: can’t
12947: help
12948: that
12949: said
12950: the
12951: cat
12952: we’re
12953: all
12954: mad
12955: here
12956: i’m
12957: mad
12958: you’re
12959: mad

12962: you
12963: know
12964: i’m
12965: mad
12966: said
12967: alice
12968: you
12969: must
12970: be
12971: said
12972: the
12973: cat
12974: or
12975: you
12976: wouldn’t
12977: have
12978: come
12979: here
12980: alice
12981: didn’t
12982: think
12983: that
12984: proved
12985: it
12986: at
12987: all
12988: however
12989: she
12990: went
12991: on
12992: and
12993: how
12994: do
12995: you
12996: know
12997: that
12998: you’re
12999: mad
13000: to
13001: begin
13002: with

13004: the
13005: cat
13006: a
13007: dog’s
13008: not
13009: mad
13010: you
13011: grant
13012: that
13013: i
13014: suppose
13015: so
13016: said
13017: alice
13018: well
13019: then
13020: the
13021: cat
13022: went
13023: on
13024: you
13025: see
13026: a
13027: dog
13028: growls
13029: when
13030: it’s
13031: angry
13032: and
13033: wags
13034: its
13035: tail
13036: when
13037: it’s
13038: pleased
13039: now
13040: i
13041: growl
13042: when
13043: i’m
13044: pleased
13045: and
13046: wag
13047: my
13048: tail
13049: when
13050: i’m
13051: angry
13052: therefore
13053: i’m
13054: mad
13055: i
13056: call
13057: it
13058: purring
13059: not
13060: growling
13061: said
13062: alice
13063: call
13064: it
13065: what
13066: you
13067: like
13068: said
13069: the
13070: cat
13071: do
13072: you
13073: play
13074: croquet
13075: with
13076: the
13077: queen
13078: to-day
13079: i
13080: should
13081: like
13082: it
13083: very
13084: much
13085: said
13086: alice
13087: but
13088: i
13089: haven’t
13090: been
13091: invited
13092: yet
13093: you’ll
13094: see
13095: me
13096: there
13097: said
13098: the
13099: cat
13100: and
13101: vanished
13102: alice
13103: was
13104: not
13105: much
13106: surprised
13107: at
13108: this
13109: she
13110: was
13111: getting
13112: so
13113: used
13114: to
13115: queer
13116: things
13117: happening
13118: while
13119: she
13120: was
13121: looking
13122: at
13123: the
13124: place
13125: where
13126: it
13127: had
13128: been
13129: it
13130: suddenly
13131: appeared
13132: again
13133: by-the-bye
13134: what
13135: became
13136: of
13137: the
13138: baby
13139: said
13140: the
13141: cat
13142: i’d
13143: nearly
13144: forgotten
13145: to
13146: ask
13147: it
13148: turned
13149: into
13150: a
13151: pig
13152: alice
13153: quietly
13154: said
13155: just
13156: as
13157: if
13158: it
13159: had
13160: come
13161: back
13162: in
13163: a
13164: natural
13165: way
13166: i
13167: thought
13168: it
13169: would
13170: said
13171: the
13172: cat
13173: and
13174: vanished
13175: again
13176: alice
13177: waited
13178: a
13179: little
13180: half
13181: expecting
13182: to
13183: see
13184: it
13185: again
13186: but
13187: it
13188: did
13189: not
13190: appear
13191: and
13192: after
13193: a
13194: minute
13195: or
13196: two
13197: she
13198: walked
13199: on
13200: in
13201: the
13202: direction
13203: in
13204: which
13205: the
13206: march
13207: hare
13208: was
13209: said
13210: to
13211: live
13212: i’ve
13213: seen
13214: hatters
13215: before
13216: she
13217: said
13218: to
13219: herself
13220: the
13221: march
13222: hare
13223: will
13224: be
13225: much
13226: the
13227: most
13228: interesting
13229: and
13230: perhaps
13231: as
13232: this
13233: is
13234: may
13235: it
13236: won’t
13237: be
13238: raving
13239: mad—at
13240: least
13241: not
13242: so
13243: mad
13244: as
13245: it
13246: was
13247: in
13248: march
13249: as
13250: she
13251: said
13252: this
13253: she
13254: looked
13255: up
13256: and
13257: there
13258: was
13259: the
13260: cat
13261: again
13262: sitting
13263: on
13264: a
13265: branch
13266: of
13267: a
13268: tree
13269: did
13270: you
13271: say
13272: pig
13273: or
13274: fig
13275: said
13276: the
13277: cat
13278: i
13279: said
13280: pig
13281: replied
13282: alice
13283: and
13284: i
13285: wish
13286: you
13287: wouldn’t
13288: keep
13289: appearing
13290: and
13291: vanishing
13292: so
13293: suddenly
13294: you
13295: make
13296: one
13297: quite
13298: giddy
13299: all
13300: right
13301: said
13302: the
13303: cat
13304: and
13305: this
13306: time
13307: it
13308: vanished
13309: quite
13310: slowly
13311: beginning
13312: with
13313: the
13314: end
13315: of
13316: the
13317: tail
13318: and
13319: ending
13320: with
13321: the
13322: grin
13323: which
13324: remained
13325: some
13326: time
13327: after
13328: the
13329: rest
13330: of
13331: it
13332: had
13333: gone
13334: well
13335: i’ve
13336: often
13337: seen
13338: a
13339: cat
13340: without
13341: a
13342: grin
13343: thought
13344: alice
13345: but
13346: a
13347: grin
13348: without
13349: a
13350: cat
13351: it’s
13352: the
13353: most
13354: curious
13355: thing
13356: i
13357: ever
13358: saw
13359: in
13360: my
13361: life
13362: she
13363: had
13364: not
13365: gone
13366: much
13367: farther
13368: before
13369: she
13370: came
13371: in
13372: sight
13373: of
13374: the
13375: house
13376: of
13377: the
13378: march
13379: hare
13380: she
13381: thought
13382: it
13383: must
13384: be
13385: the
13386: right
13387: house
13388: because
13389: the
13390: chimneys
13391: were
13392: shaped
13393: like
13394: ears
13395: and
13396: the
13397: roof
13398: was
13399: thatched
13400: with
13401: fur
13402: it
13403: was
13404: so
13405: large
13406: a
13407: house
13408: that
13409: she
13410: did
13411: not
13412: like
13413: to
13414: go
13415: nearer
13416: till
13417: she
13418: had
13419: nibbled
13420: some
13421: more
13422: of
13423: the
13424: lefthand
13425: bit
13426: of

13969: watch
13970: out
13971: of

13979: uneasily
13980: shaking

14019: at
14020: the
14021: march
14022: hare
14023: it
14024: was
14025: the

14037: must
14038: have
14039: got
14040: in
14041: as

14043: the
14044: hatter
14045: grumbled
14046: you

14062: looked
14063: at
14064: it
14065: gloomily
14066: then
14067: he
14068: dipped

14070: into
14071: his
14072: cup
14073: of

14075: and
14076: looked
14077: at

14083: think
14084: of
14085: nothing
14086: better
14087: to

14091: first
14092: remark
14093: it
14094: was
14095: the
14096: best

14105: his
14106: shoulder
14107: with

14150: very
14151: readily
14152: but

14159: year
14160: for

14189: meaning

14231: its
14232: head
14233: impatiently
14234: and
14235: said
14236: without
14237: opening
14238: its
14239: eyes
14240: of
14241: course

14295: might
14296: do

14298: better
14299: with

14351: head
14352: contemptuously
14353: i
14354: dare

14406: liked
14407: with
14408: the
14409: clock

14425: you’d
14426: only

14429: whisper
14430: a
14431: hint
14432: to
14433: time
14434: and
14435: round

14437: the

14439: in
14440: a
14441: twinkling
14442: half-past

14458: in
14459: a
14460: whisper
14461: that
14462: would
14463: be
14464: grand
14465: certainly
14466: said
14467: alice
14468: thoughtfully
14469: but
14470: then—i
14471: shouldn’t
14472: be
14473: hungry
14474: for
14475: it
14476: you
14477: know
14478: not
14479: at
14480: first
14481: perhaps
14482: said
14483: the
14484: hatter
14485: but
14486: you
14487: could
14488: keep

14490: to
14491: half-past
14492: one

14510: head
14511: mournfully
14512: not
14513: i
14514: he
14515: replied
14516: we
14517: quarrelled
14518: last

14561: at
14562: you
14563: know
14564: the
14565: song
14566: perhaps
14567: i’ve
14568: heard
14569: something

14571: it
14572: said

14582: in
14583: this
14584: way
14585: up
14586: above
14587: the
14588: world
14589: you
14590: fly
14591: like
14592: a
14593: tea-tray
14594: in
14595: the
14596: sky
14597: twinkle

14609: sleep
14610: twinkle
14611: twinkle

14613: twinkle
14614: and
14615: went
14616: on
14617: so
14618: long
14619: that
14620: they

14634: first
14635: verse
14636: said

14650: time
14651: off
14652: with
14653: his
14654: head
14655: how
14656: dreadfully
14657: savage
14658: exclaimed
14659: alice
14660: and
14661: ever
14662: since
14663: that
14664: the
14665: hatter
14666: went
14667: on
14668: in
14669: a
14670: mournful
14671: tone
14672: he
14673: won’t
14674: do
14675: a
14676: thing

14682: o’clock
14683: now
14684: a
14685: bright
14686: idea

14688: into
14689: alice’s
14690: head
14691: is
14692: that
14693: the
14694: reason

14705: that’s
14706: it
14707: said
14708: the
14709: hatter
14710: with
14711: a
14712: sigh
14713: it’s

14715: tea-time
14716: and

14729: moving
14730: round
14731: i
14732: suppose

14734: alice
14735: exactly
14736: so
14737: said
14738: the
14739: hatter
14740: as
14741: the
14742: things
14743: get
14744: used
14745: up
14746: but

14754: beginning
14755: again

14790: said
14791: alice
14792: rather
14793: alarmed

14823: wasn’t
14824: asleep
14825: he

14912: a
14913: great
14914: interest
14915: in
14916: questions
14917: of

14919: and
14920: drinking
14921: they
14922: lived
14923: on
14924: treacle
14925: said
14926: the
14927: dormouse
14928: after

14930: a
14931: minute
14932: or
14933: two
14934: they
14935: couldn’t

14938: that
14939: you
14940: know
14941: alice
14942: gently
14943: remarked
14944: they’d
14945: have
14946: been
14947: ill
14948: so
14949: they
14950: were
14951: said
14952: the
14953: dormouse
14954: very
14955: ill
14956: alice
14957: tried
14958: to
14959: fancy
14960: to
14961: herself
14962: what
14963: such
14964: an
14965: extraordinary
14966: ways
14967: of
14968: living
14969: would
14970: be
14971: like
14972: but
14973: it
14974: puzzled
14975: her
14976: too
14977: much
14978: so
14979: she
14980: went
14981: on
14982: but
14983: why
14984: did
14985: they
14986: live
14987: at
14988: the
14989: bottom

15000: said
15001: to
15002: alice
15003: very
15004: earnestly
15005: i’ve
15006: had
15007: nothing
15008: yet
15009: alice
15010: replied
15011: in
15012: an
15013: offended
15014: tone
15015: so
15016: i
15017: can’t
15018: take
15019: more
15020: you
15021: mean
15022: you
15023: can’t
15024: take
15025: less
15026: said
15027: the
15028: hatter
15029: it’s
15030: very
15031: easy
15032: to
15033: take
15034: more
15035: than
15036: nothing
15037: nobody
15038: asked
15039: your
15040: opinion
15041: said
15042: alice
15043: who’s
15044: making
15045: personal
15046: remarks
15047: now
15048: the
15049: hatter
15050: asked
15051: triumphantly
15052: alice
15053: did
15054: not
15055: quite
15056: know
15057: what
15058: to
15059: say
15060: to
15061: this
15062: so
15063: she
15064: helped
15065: herself
15066: to
15067: some
15068: tea
15069: and
15070: bread-and-butter
15071: and
15072: then
15073: turned
15074: to
15075: the
15076: dormouse
15077: and
15078: repeated
15079: her
15080: question
15081: why
15082: did
15083: they
15084: live
15085: at
15086: the
15087: bottom
15088: of
15089: a
15090: well
15091: the
15092: dormouse
15093: again
15094: took
15095: a
15096: minute
15097: or
15098: two
15099: to
15100: think
15101: about
15102: it
15103: and
15104: then
15105: said
15106: it
15107: was
15108: a
15109: treacle-well
15110: there’s
15111: no
15112: such
15113: thing
15114: alice
15115: was
15116: beginning
15117: very
15118: angrily
15119: but
15120: the
15121: hatter
15122: and
15123: the
15124: march
15125: hare
15126: went
15127: sh
15128: sh
15129: and
15130: the
15131: dormouse
15132: sulkily
15133: remarked
15134: if
15135: you
15136: can’t
15137: be
15138: civil
15139: you’d
15140: better
15141: finish
15142: the
15143: story
15144: for
15145: yourself
15146: no
15147: please
15148: go
15149: on
15150: alice
15151: said
15152: very
15153: humbly
15154: i
15155: won’t
15156: interrupt
15157: again
15158: i
15159: dare
15160: say
15161: there
15162: may
15163: be
15164: one
15165: one
15166: indeed
15167: said
15168: the
15169: dormouse
15170: indignantly
15171: however
15172: he
15173: consented
15174: to
15175: go
15176: on
15177: and
15178: so
15179: these
15180: three
15181: little
15182: sisters—they
15183: were
15184: learning
15185: to
15186: draw
15187: you
15188: know
15189: what
15190: did
15191: they
15192: draw
15193: said
15194: alice
15195: quite
15196: forgetting
15197: her
15198: promise
15199: treacle
15200: said
15201: the
15202: dormouse
15203: without
15204: considering
15205: at
15206: all
15207: this
15208: time
15209: i
15210: want
15211: a
15212: clean
15213: cup
15214: interrupted
15215: the
15216: hatter
15217: let’s
15218: all
15219: move
15220: one
15221: place
15222: on
15223: he
15224: moved
15225: on
15226: as
15227: he
15228: spoke
15229: and
15230: the
15231: dormouse
15232: followed
15233: him
15234: the
15235: march
15236: hare
15237: moved
15238: into
15239: the
15240: dormouse’s
15241: place
15242: and
15243: alice
15244: rather
15245: unwillingly
15246: took
15247: the
15248: place
15249: of
15250: the
15251: march
15252: hare
15253: the
15254: hatter
15255: was
15256: the
15257: only
15258: one
15259: who
15260: got
15261: any
15262: advantage
15263: from
15264: the
15265: change
15266: and
15267: alice
15268: was
15269: a
15270: good
15271: deal
15272: worse
15273: off
15274: than
15275: before
15276: as
15277: the
15278: march
15279: hare
15280: had
15281: just
15282: upset
15283: the
15284: milk-jug
15285: into
15286: his
15287: plate
15288: alice
15289: did
15290: not
15291: wish
15292: to
15293: offend
15294: the
15295: dormouse
15296: again
15297: so
15298: she
15299: began
15300: very
15301: cautiously
15302: but
15303: i
15304: don’t
15305: understand
15306: where
15307: did
15308: they
15309: draw
15310: the
15311: treacle
15312: from
15313: you
15314: can
15315: draw
15316: water
15317: out
15318: of
15319: a
15320: water-well
15321: said
15322: the
15323: hatter
15324: so
15325: i
15326: should
15327: think
15328: you
15329: could
15330: draw
15331: treacle
15332: out
15333: of
15334: a
15335: treacle-well—eh
15336: stupid
15337: but
15338: they
15339: were
15340: in
15341: the
15342: well
15343: alice
15344: said
15345: to
15346: the
15347: dormouse
15348: not
15349: choosing
15350: to
15351: notice
15352: this
15353: last
15354: remark
15355: of
15356: course
15357: they
15358: were
15359: said
15360: the
15361: dormouse
15362: well
15363: in
15364: this
15365: answer
15366: so
15367: confused
15368: poor
15369: alice
15370: that
15371: she
15372: let
15373: the
15374: dormouse
15375: go
15376: on
15377: for
15378: some
15379: time
15380: without
15381: interrupting
15382: it
15383: they
15384: were
15385: learning
15386: to
15387: draw
15388: the
15389: dormouse
15390: went
15391: on
15392: yawning
15393: and
15394: rubbing
15395: its
15396: eyes
15397: for
15398: it
15399: was
15400: getting
15401: very
15402: sleepy
15403: and
15404: they
15405: drew
15406: all
15407: manner
15408: of
15409: things—everything
15410: that
15411: begins
15412: with
15413: an
15414: m
15415: why
15416: with
15417: an
15418: m
15419: said
15420: alice
15421: why
15422: not
15423: said
15424: the
15425: march
15426: hare
15427: alice
15428: was
15429: silent
15430: the
15431: dormouse
15432: had
15433: closed
15434: its
15435: eyes
15436: by
15437: this
15438: time
15439: and
15440: was
15441: going
15442: off
15443: into
15444: a
15445: doze
15446: but
15447: on
15448: being
15449: pinched
15450: by
15451: the
15452: hatter
15453: it
15454: woke
15455: up
15456: again
15457: with
15458: a
15459: little
15460: shriek
15461: and
15462: went
15463: on
15464: that
15465: begins
15466: with
15467: an
15468: m
15469: such
15470: as
15471: mouse-traps
15472: and
15473: the
15474: moon
15475: and
15476: memory
15477: and
15478: muchness—you
15479: know
15480: you
15481: say
15482: things
15483: are
15484: much
15485: of
15486: a
15487: muchness”—did
15488: you
15489: ever
15490: see
15491: such
15492: a
15493: thing
15494: as
15495: a
15496: drawing
15497: of
15498: a
15499: muchness
15500: really
15501: now
15502: you
15503: ask
15504: me
15505: said
15506: alice
15507: very
15508: much
15509: confused
15510: i
15511: don’t
15512: think
15513: then
15514: you
15515: shouldn’t
15516: talk
15517: said
15518: the
15519: hatter
15520: this
15521: piece
15522: of
15523: rudeness
15524: was
15525: more
15526: than
15527: alice
15528: could
15529: bear
15530: she
15531: got
15532: up
15533: in
15534: great
15535: disgust
15536: and
15537: walked

15540: dormouse
15541: fell
15542: asleep
15543: instantly
15544: and
15545: neither
15546: of
15547: the
15548: others
15549: took
15550: the
15551: least
15552: notice
15553: of
15554: her
15555: going
15556: though
15557: she
15558: looked
15559: back
15560: once
15561: or
15562: twice
15563: half
15564: hoping
15565: that
15566: they
15567: would
15568: call
15569: after
15570: her
15571: the
15572: last
15573: time
15574: she
15575: saw
15576: them
15577: they
15578: were
15579: trying
15580: to
15581: put
15582: the
15583: dormouse
15584: into
15585: the
15586: teapot
15587: at

15591: never
15592: go
15593: there
15594: again
15595: said
15596: alice
15597: as
15598: she
15599: picked
15600: her
15601: way
15602: through
15603: the
15604: wood
15605: it’s
15606: the
15607: stupidest
15608: tea-party
15609: i
15610: ever
15611: was
15612: at
15613: in
15614: all
15615: my
15616: life
15617: just
15618: as
15619: she
15620: said
15621: this
15622: she
15623: noticed
15624: that
15625: one
15626: of

15660: more
15661: she
15662: found
15663: herself
15664: in

15667: hall
15668: and

15676: i’ll
15677: manage
15678: better
15679: this
15680: time
15681: she
15682: said
15683: to
15684: herself
15685: and
15686: began
15687: by
15688: taking
15689: the
15690: little
15691: golden
15692: key

15707: nibbling
15708: at
15709: the

15723: was
15724: about
15725: a
15726: foot
15727: high
15728: then
15729: she
15730: walked
15731: down
15732: the
15733: little
15734: passage
15735: and
15736: then_—she

15946: looked
15947: round

16057: the
16058: queen
16059: and
16060: the

16062: gardeners
16063: instantly
16064: threw

16069: faces
16070: there

16072: a
16073: sound
16074: of
16075: many
16076: footsteps
16077: and
16078: alice
16079: looked
16080: round
16081: eager
16082: to

16092: these
16093: were
16094: all
16095: shaped
16096: like
16097: the
16098: three
16099: gardeners
16100: oblong
16101: and
16102: flat
16103: with
16104: their
16105: hands
16106: and
16107: feet
16108: at
16109: the
16110: corners
16111: next
16112: the
16113: ten
16114: courtiers
16115: these
16116: were
16117: ornamented

16119: over
16120: with
16121: diamonds
16122: and
16123: walked
16124: two
16125: and
16126: two
16127: as
16128: the
16129: soldiers
16130: did
16131: after

16134: the
16135: royal
16136: children
16137: there

16144: little
16145: dears
16146: came
16147: jumping
16148: merrily
16149: along
16150: hand
16151: in
16152: hand
16153: in
16154: couples
16155: they
16156: were
16157: all
16158: ornamented
16159: with
16160: hearts
16161: next

16163: the
16164: guests
16165: mostly
16166: kings
16167: and
16168: queens
16169: and
16170: among
16171: them
16172: alice
16173: recognised
16174: the
16175: white
16176: rabbit
16177: it
16178: was
16179: talking
16180: in
16181: a
16182: hurried
16183: nervous
16184: manner
16185: smiling
16186: at
16187: everything
16188: that
16189: was
16190: said
16191: and
16192: went
16193: by
16194: without
16195: noticing
16196: her
16197: then
16198: followed
16199: the
16200: knave
16201: of
16202: hearts
16203: carrying
16204: the
16205: king’s
16206: crown
16207: on
16208: a
16209: crimson
16210: velvet
16211: cushion
16212: and
16213: last
16214: of
16215: all
16216: this
16217: grand
16218: procession
16219: came
16220: the
16221: king
16222: and
16223: queen
16224: of
16225: hearts
16226: alice
16227: was
16228: rather
16229: doubtful
16230: whether
16231: she
16232: ought
16233: not
16234: to
16235: lie
16236: down
16237: on
16238: her
16239: face
16240: like
16241: the
16242: three
16243: gardeners
16244: but
16245: she
16246: could
16247: not
16248: remember
16249: ever
16250: having
16251: heard
16252: of
16253: such
16254: a
16255: rule
16256: at
16257: processions
16258: and
16259: besides
16260: what
16261: would
16262: be
16263: the
16264: use
16265: of
16266: a
16267: procession
16268: thought
16269: she
16270: if
16271: people
16272: had
16273: all
16274: to
16275: lie
16276: down
16277: upon
16278: their
16279: faces
16280: so
16281: that
16282: they
16283: couldn’t
16284: see
16285: it
16286: so
16287: she
16288: stood
16289: still
16290: where
16291: she
16292: was
16293: and
16294: waited
16295: when
16296: the
16297: procession
16298: came
16299: opposite
16300: to
16301: alice
16302: they
16303: all
16304: stopped
16305: and
16306: looked
16307: at
16308: her
16309: and
16310: the
16311: queen
16312: said
16313: severely
16314: who
16315: is
16316: this
16317: she
16318: said
16319: it
16320: to
16321: the
16322: knave
16323: of
16324: hearts
16325: who
16326: only
16327: bowed
16328: and
16329: smiled
16330: in
16331: reply
16332: idiot
16333: said
16334: the
16335: queen
16336: tossing
16337: her
16338: head
16339: impatiently
16340: and
16341: turning
16342: to
16343: alice
16344: she
16345: went
16346: on
16347: what’s
16348: your
16349: name
16350: child
16351: my
16352: name
16353: is
16354: alice
16355: so
16356: please
16357: your
16358: majesty
16359: said
16360: alice
16361: very
16362: politely
16363: but
16364: she
16365: added

16681: or
16682: two
16683: looking

16731: alice
16732: as
16733: the
16734: question

16749: and
16750: alice
16751: joined
16752: the
16753: procession
16754: wondering

16756: much
16757: what
16758: would
16759: happen
16760: next
16761: it’s—it’s
16762: a
16763: very
16764: fine
16765: day

16767: a
16768: timid
16769: voice
16770: at
16771: her
16772: side
16773: she
16774: was
16775: walking

16783: anxiously
16784: into
16785: her
16786: face
16787: very
16788: said

16798: in
16799: a
16800: low
16801: hurried
16802: tone
16803: he
16804: looked
16805: anxiously
16806: over
16807: his
16808: shoulder
16809: as
16810: he
16811: spoke
16812: and
16813: then
16814: raised
16815: himself
16816: upon
16817: tiptoe
16818: put
16819: his
16820: mouth
16821: close
16822: to
16823: her
16824: ear
16825: and
16826: whispered
16827: she’s
16828: under
16829: sentence
16830: of
16831: execution
16832: what

16852: think
16853: it’s
16854: at

16861: for
16862: she
16863: boxed
16864: the
16865: queen’s
16866: ears
16867: the
16868: rabbit
16869: began
16870: alice
16871: gave
16872: a
16873: little
16874: scream
16875: of
16876: laughter
16877: oh
16878: hush
16879: the
16880: rabbit
16881: whispered
16882: in
16883: a
16884: frightened
16885: tone
16886: the
16887: queen
16888: will
16889: hear
16890: you
16891: you
16892: see
16893: she
16894: came
16895: rather
16896: late
16897: and
16898: the
16899: queen
16900: said
16901: get
16902: to
16903: your
16904: places
16905: shouted
16906: the
16907: queen
16908: in
16909: a
16910: voice
16911: of
16912: thunder
16913: and
16914: people
16915: began
16916: running
16917: about
16918: in
16919: all
16920: directions
16921: tumbling
16922: up
16923: against
16924: each
16925: other
16926: however
16927: they
16928: got
16929: settled
16930: down
16931: in
16932: a
16933: minute
16934: or
16935: two
16936: and
16937: the
16938: game

16942: she
16943: had
16944: never
16945: seen
16946: such
16947: a
16948: curious
16949: croquet-ground
16950: in
16951: her
16952: life
16953: it
16954: was
16955: all
16956: ridges
16957: and
16958: furrows
16959: the
16960: balls
16961: were
16962: live
16963: hedgehogs
16964: the
16965: mallets
16966: live
16967: flamingoes
16968: and
16969: the
16970: soldiers
16971: had
16972: to
16973: double
16974: themselves
16975: up
16976: and
16977: to
16978: stand
16979: on
16980: their
16981: hands
16982: and
16983: feet
16984: to
16985: make
16986: the
16987: arches
16988: the
16989: chief
16990: difficulty
16991: alice
16992: found
16993: at
16994: first
16995: was
16996: in
16997: managing
16998: her
16999: flamingo
17000: she
17001: succeeded
17002: in
17003: getting
17004: its
17005: body
17006: tucked
17007: away
17008: comfortably
17009: enough
17010: under
17011: her
17012: arm
17013: with
17014: its
17015: legs
17016: hanging
17017: down
17018: but
17019: generally
17020: just
17021: as
17022: she
17023: had
17024: got
17025: its
17026: neck
17027: nicely
17028: straightened
17029: out
17030: and
17031: was
17032: going
17033: to
17034: give
17035: the
17036: hedgehog
17037: a
17038: blow
17039: with
17040: its
17041: head
17042: it
17043: would
17044: twist
17045: itself
17046: round
17047: and
17048: look
17049: up
17050: in
17051: her
17052: face
17053: with
17054: such
17055: a
17056: puzzled
17057: expression
17058: that
17059: she
17060: could
17061: not
17062: help
17063: bursting
17064: out
17065: laughing
17066: and
17067: when
17068: she
17069: had
17070: got
17071: its
17072: head
17073: down
17074: and
17075: was
17076: going
17077: to
17078: begin
17079: again
17080: it
17081: was
17082: very
17083: provoking
17084: to
17085: find
17086: that
17087: the
17088: hedgehog
17089: had
17090: unrolled
17091: itself
17092: and
17093: was
17094: in
17095: the
17096: act
17097: of
17098: crawling
17099: away
17100: besides
17101: all
17102: this
17103: there
17104: was
17105: generally
17106: a
17107: ridge
17108: or
17109: furrow
17110: in
17111: the
17112: way
17113: wherever
17114: she
17115: wanted
17116: to
17117: send
17118: the
17119: hedgehog
17120: to
17121: and
17122: as
17123: the
17124: doubled-up
17125: soldiers
17126: were
17127: always
17128: getting
17129: up
17130: and
17131: walking
17132: off
17133: to
17134: other
17135: parts
17136: of
17137: the
17138: ground
17139: alice
17140: soon
17141: came
17142: to
17143: the
17144: conclusion
17145: that
17146: it
17147: was
17148: a
17149: very
17150: difficult
17151: game
17152: indeed
17153: the
17154: players
17155: all
17156: played
17157: at
17158: once
17159: without
17160: waiting
17161: for
17162: turns
17163: quarrelling
17164: all
17165: the
17166: while
17167: and
17168: fighting
17169: for
17170: the
17171: hedgehogs
17172: and
17173: in
17174: a
17175: very
17176: short
17177: time
17178: the
17179: queen
17180: was
17181: in
17182: a
17183: furious
17184: passion
17185: and
17186: went
17187: stamping
17188: about
17189: and
17190: shouting
17191: off
17192: with
17193: his
17194: head
17195: or
17196: off
17197: with
17198: her
17199: head
17200: about
17201: once
17202: in
17203: a
17204: minute
17205: alice
17206: began
17207: to
17208: feel
17209: very
17210: uneasy
17211: to
17212: be
17213: sure
17214: she
17215: had
17216: not
17217: as
17218: yet
17219: had
17220: any
17221: dispute
17222: with
17223: the
17224: queen
17225: but
17226: she
17227: knew
17228: that
17229: it
17230: might
17231: happen
17232: any
17233: minute
17234: and
17235: then
17236: thought
17237: she
17238: what
17239: would
17240: become
17241: of
17242: me
17243: they’re
17244: dreadfully
17245: fond
17246: of
17247: beheading
17248: people
17249: here
17250: the
17251: great
17252: wonder
17253: is
17254: that
17255: there’s
17256: any
17257: one
17258: left
17259: alive
17260: she
17261: was
17262: looking
17263: about
17264: for
17265: some
17266: way
17267: of
17268: escape
17269: and
17270: wondering
17271: whether
17272: she
17273: could
17274: get
17275: away
17276: without
17277: being
17278: seen
17279: when
17280: she
17281: noticed
17282: a
17283: curious
17284: appearance
17285: in
17286: the
17287: air
17288: it
17289: puzzled
17290: her
17291: very
17292: much
17293: at
17294: first
17295: but
17296: after
17297: watching
17298: it
17299: a
17300: minute
17301: or
17302: two
17303: she
17304: made
17305: it
17306: out
17307: to
17308: be
17309: a
17310: grin
17311: and
17312: she
17313: said
17314: to
17315: herself
17316: it’s
17317: the
17318: cheshire
17319: cat
17320: now
17321: i
17322: shall
17323: have
17324: somebody
17325: to
17326: talk
17327: to
17328: how
17329: are
17330: you
17331: getting
17332: on
17333: said
17334: the
17335: cat
17336: as
17337: soon
17338: as
17339: there
17340: was
17341: mouth
17342: enough
17343: for
17344: it
17345: to
17346: speak
17347: with
17348: alice
17349: waited
17350: till
17351: the
17352: eyes
17353: appeared
17354: and
17355: then
17356: nodded
17357: it’s
17358: no
17359: use
17360: speaking
17361: to
17362: it
17363: she
17364: thought
17365: till
17366: its
17367: ears
17368: have
17369: come
17370: or
17371: at
17372: least
17373: one
17374: of
17375: them
17376: in
17377: another
17378: minute
17379: the
17380: whole
17381: head
17382: appeared
17383: and
17384: then
17385: alice
17386: put
17387: down
17388: her
17389: flamingo
17390: and
17391: began
17392: an
17393: account
17394: of
17395: the
17396: game
17397: feeling
17398: very
17399: glad
17400: she
17401: had
17402: someone
17403: to
17404: listen
17405: to
17406: her
17407: the
17408: cat
17409: seemed
17410: to
17411: think
17412: that
17413: there
17414: was
17415: enough
17416: of
17417: it
17418: now
17419: in
17420: sight
17421: and
17422: no
17423: more
17424: of
17425: it
17426: appeared
17427: i
17428: don’t
17429: think
17430: they
17431: play
17432: at
17433: all
17434: fairly
17435: alice
17436: began
17437: in
17438: rather
17439: a
17440: complaining
17441: tone
17442: and
17443: they
17444: all
17445: quarrel
17446: so
17447: dreadfully
17448: one
17449: can’t
17450: hear
17451: oneself
17452: speak—and
17453: they
17454: don’t
17455: seem
17456: to
17457: have
17458: any
17459: rules
17460: in
17461: particular
17462: at
17463: least
17464: if
17465: there
17466: are
17467: nobody
17468: attends
17469: to
17470: them—and
17471: you’ve
17472: no
17473: idea
17474: how
17475: confusing
17476: it
17477: is
17478: all
17479: the
17480: things
17481: being
17482: alive
17483: for
17484: instance
17485: there’s
17486: the
17487: arch
17488: i’ve
17489: got
17490: to
17491: go
17492: through
17493: next
17494: walking
17495: about
17496: at
17497: the
17498: other
17499: end
17500: of
17501: the
17502: ground—and
17503: i
17504: should
17505: have
17506: croqueted
17507: the
17508: queen’s
17509: hedgehog
17510: just
17511: now
17512: only
17513: it
17514: ran
17515: away
17516: when
17517: it
17518: saw
17519: mine
17520: coming
17521: how
17522: do
17523: you
17524: like
17525: the
17526: queen
17527: said
17528: the
17529: cat
17530: in
17531: a
17532: low
17533: voice
17534: not
17535: at
17536: all
17537: said
17538: alice
17539: she’s
17540: so
17541: extremely
17542: just
17543: then
17544: she
17545: noticed
17546: that
17547: the
17548: queen
17549: was
17550: close
17551: behind
17552: her
17553: listening
17554: so
17555: she
17556: went
17557: on
17558: likely
17559: to
17560: win
17561: that
17562: it’s
17563: hardly
17564: worth
17565: while
17566: finishing
17567: the
17568: game
17569: the
17570: queen
17571: smiled
17572: and
17573: passed
17574: on
17575: who
17576: are
17577: you
17578: talking
17579: to
17580: said
17581: the
17582: king
17583: going
17584: up
17585: to
17586: alice
17587: and
17588: looking
17589: at
17590: the
17591: cat’s
17592: head
17593: with
17594: great
17595: curiosity
17596: it’s
17597: a
17598: friend
17599: of
17600: mine—a
17601: cheshire
17602: cat
17603: said
17604: alice
17605: allow
17606: me
17607: to
17608: introduce
17609: it
17610: i
17611: don’t
17612: like
17613: the
17614: look
17615: of
17616: it
17617: at
17618: all
17619: said
17620: the
17621: king
17622: however
17623: it
17624: may
17625: kiss
17626: my
17627: hand
17628: if
17629: it
17630: likes
17631: i’d
17632: rather
17633: not
17634: the
17635: cat
17636: remarked
17637: don’t
17638: be
17639: impertinent
17640: said
17641: the
17642: king
17643: and
17644: don’t
17645: look
17646: at
17647: me
17648: like
17649: that
17650: he
17651: got
17652: behind
17653: alice
17654: as
17655: he
17656: spoke
17657: a
17658: cat
17659: may
17660: look
17661: at
17662: a
17663: king
17664: said
17665: alice
17666: i’ve
17667: read
17668: that
17669: in
17670: some
17671: book
17672: but
17673: i
17674: don’t
17675: remember
17676: where
17677: well
17678: it
17679: must
17680: be
17681: removed
17682: said
17683: the
17684: king
17685: very
17686: decidedly
17687: and
17688: he
17689: called
17690: the
17691: queen
17692: who
17693: was
17694: passing
17695: at
17696: the
17697: moment
17698: my
17699: dear
17700: i
17701: wish
17702: you
17703: would
17704: have
17705: this
17706: cat
17707: removed
17708: the
17709: queen
17710: had
17711: only
17712: one
17713: way
17714: of
17715: settling
17716: all
17717: difficulties
17718: great
17719: or
17720: small
17721: off
17722: with
17723: his
17724: head
17725: she
17726: said
17727: without
17728: even
17729: looking
17730: round
17731: i’ll
17732: fetch
17733: the
17734: executioner
17735: myself
17736: said
17737: the
17738: king
17739: eagerly
17740: and
17741: he
17742: hurried
17743: off
17744: alice
17745: thought
17746: she
17747: might
17748: as
17749: well
17750: go
17751: back
17752: and
17753: see
17754: how
17755: the
17756: game
17757: was
17758: going
17759: on
17760: as
17761: she
17762: heard
17763: the
17764: queen’s
17765: voice
17766: in
17767: the
17768: distance
17769: screaming
17770: with
17771: passion
17772: she
17773: had
17774: already
17775: heard
17776: her
17777: sentence
17778: three
17779: of
17780: the
17781: players
17782: to
17783: be
17784: executed
17785: for
17786: having
17787: missed
17788: their
17789: turns
17790: and
17791: she
17792: did
17793: not
17794: like
17795: the
17796: look
17797: of
17798: things
17799: at
17800: all
17801: as
17802: the
17803: game
17804: was
17805: in
17806: such
17807: confusion
17808: that
17809: she
17810: never
17811: knew
17812: whether
17813: it
17814: was
17815: her
17816: turn
17817: or
17818: not
17819: so
17820: she
17821: went
17822: in
17823: search
17824: of
17825: her
17826: hedgehog
17827: the
17828: hedgehog
17829: was
17830: engaged
17831: in
17832: a
17833: fight
17834: with
17835: another
17836: hedgehog
17837: which
17838: seemed
17839: to
17840: alice
17841: an
17842: excellent
17843: opportunity
17844: for
17845: croqueting
17846: one
17847: of
17848: them
17849: with
17850: the
17851: other
17852: the
17853: only
17854: difficulty
17855: was
17856: that
17857: her
17858: flamingo
17859: was
17860: gone
17861: across
17862: to
17863: the
17864: other
17865: side
17866: of
17867: the
17868: garden
17869: where
17870: alice
17871: could
17872: see
17873: it
17874: trying
17875: in
17876: a
17877: helpless
17878: sort
17879: of
17880: way
17881: to
17882: fly
17883: up
17884: into
17885: a
17886: tree
17887: by
17888: the
17889: time
17890: she
17891: had
17892: caught
17893: the
17894: flamingo
17895: and
17896: brought
17897: it
17898: back
17899: the
17900: fight
17901: was
17902: over
17903: and
17904: both
17905: the
17906: hedgehogs
17907: were
17908: out
17909: of
17910: sight
17911: but
17912: it
17913: doesn’t
17914: matter
17915: much
17916: thought
17917: alice
17918: as
17919: all
17920: the
17921: arches
17922: are
17923: gone
17924: from
17925: this
17926: side
17927: of
17928: the
17929: ground
17930: so
17931: she
17932: tucked
17933: it
17934: away
17935: under
17936: her
17937: arm
17938: that
17939: it
17940: might
17941: not
17942: escape
17943: again
17944: and
17945: went
17946: back
17947: for
17948: a
17949: little
17950: more
17951: conversation
17952: with
17953: her
17954: friend
17955: when
17956: she
17957: got
17958: back
17959: to
17960: the
17961: cheshire
17962: cat
17963: she
17964: was
17965: surprised
17966: to
17967: find
17968: quite
17969: a
17970: large
17971: crowd
17972: collected
17973: round
17974: it
17975: there
17976: was
17977: a
17978: dispute
17979: going
17980: on
17981: between
17982: the
17983: executioner
17984: the
17985: king
17986: and
17987: the
17988: queen
17989: who
17990: were
17991: all
17992: talking
17993: at
17994: once
17995: while
17996: all
17997: the
17998: rest
17999: were
18000: quite
18001: silent
18002: and
18003: looked
18004: very
18005: uncomfortable
18006: the
18007: moment
18008: alice
18009: appeared
18010: she
18011: was
18012: appealed
18013: to
18014: by
18015: all
18016: three
18017: to
18018: settle
18019: the
18020: question
18021: and
18022: they
18023: repeated
18024: their
18025: arguments
18026: to
18027: her
18028: though
18029: as
18030: they
18031: all
18032: spoke
18033: at
18034: once
18035: she
18036: found
18037: it
18038: very
18039: hard
18040: indeed
18041: to
18042: make
18043: out
18044: exactly
18045: what
18046: they
18047: said
18048: the
18049: executioner’s
18050: argument
18051: was
18052: that
18053: you
18054: couldn’t
18055: cut
18056: off
18057: a
18058: head
18059: unless
18060: there
18061: was
18062: a
18063: body
18064: to
18065: cut
18066: it
18067: off
18068: from
18069: that
18070: he
18071: had
18072: never
18073: had
18074: to
18075: do
18076: such
18077: a
18078: thing
18079: before
18080: and
18081: he
18082: wasn’t
18083: going
18084: to
18085: begin
18086: at
18087: his
18088: time
18089: of
18090: life
18091: the
18092: king’s
18093: argument
18094: was
18095: that
18096: anything
18097: that
18098: had
18099: a
18100: head
18101: could
18102: be
18103: beheaded
18104: and
18105: that
18106: you
18107: weren’t
18108: to
18109: talk
18110: nonsense
18111: the
18112: queen’s
18113: argument
18114: was
18115: that
18116: if
18117: something
18118: wasn’t
18119: done
18120: about
18121: it
18122: in
18123: less
18124: than
18125: no
18126: time
18127: she’d
18128: have
18129: everybody
18130: executed
18131: all
18132: round
18133: it
18134: was
18135: this
18136: last
18137: remark
18138: that
18139: had
18140: made
18141: the
18142: whole
18143: party
18144: look
18145: so
18146: grave
18147: and
18148: anxious
18149: alice
18150: could
18151: think
18152: of
18153: nothing
18154: else
18155: to
18156: say
18157: but
18158: it
18159: belongs
18160: to
18161: the
18162: duchess
18163: you’d
18164: better
18165: ask
18166: her
18167: about
18168: it
18169: she’s
18170: in
18171: prison
18172: the
18173: queen
18174: said
18175: to
18176: the
18177: executioner
18178: fetch
18179: her
18180: here
18181: and
18182: the
18183: executioner
18184: went
18185: off
18186: like
18187: an
18188: arrow
18189: the
18190: cat’s
18191: head
18192: began
18193: fading
18194: away
18195: the
18196: moment
18197: he
18198: was
18199: gone
18200: and
18201: by
18202: the
18203: time
18204: he
18205: had
18206: come
18207: back
18208: with
18209: the
18210: duchess
18211: it
18212: had
18213: entirely
18214: disappeared
18215: so
18216: the
18217: king
18218: and
18219: the
18220: executioner
18221: ran
18222: wildly
18223: up
18224: and
18225: down
18226: looking
18227: for
18228: it
18229: while
18230: the
18231: rest
18232: of
18233: the
18234: party
18235: went
18236: back
18237: to
18238: the
18239: game
18240: chapter
18241: ix
18242: the
18243: mock
18244: turtle’s
18245: story
18246: you
18247: can’t
18248: think
18249: how
18250: glad
18251: i
18252: am
18253: to
18254: see
18255: you
18256: again
18257: you
18258: dear
18259: old
18260: thing
18261: said
18262: the
18263: duchess
18264: as
18265: she
18266: tucked
18267: her
18268: arm
18269: affectionately
18270: into
18271: alice’s
18272: and
18273: they
18274: walked
18275: off
18276: together
18277: alice
18278: was
18279: very
18280: glad
18281: to
18282: find
18283: her
18284: in
18285: such
18286: a
18287: pleasant
18288: temper
18289: and
18290: thought
18291: to
18292: herself
18293: that
18294: perhaps
18295: it
18296: was
18297: only
18298: the
18299: pepper
18300: that
18301: had
18302: made
18303: her
18304: so
18305: savage
18306: when
18307: they
18308: met
18309: in
18310: the
18311: kitchen
18312: when
18313: i’m
18314: a
18315: duchess
18316: she
18317: said
18318: to
18319: herself
18320: not
18321: in
18322: a
18323: very
18324: hopeful
18325: tone
18326: though
18327: i
18328: won’t
18329: have
18330: any
18331: pepper
18332: in
18333: my
18334: kitchen
18335: at
18336: all
18337: soup
18338: does
18339: very
18340: well
18341: without—maybe
18342: it’s
18343: always
18344: pepper
18345: that
18346: makes
18347: people
18348: hot-tempered
18349: she
18350: went
18351: on
18352: very
18353: much
18354: pleased
18355: at
18356: having
18357: found
18358: out
18359: a
18360: new
18361: kind
18362: of
18363: rule
18364: and
18365: vinegar
18366: that
18367: makes
18368: them
18369: sour—and
18370: camomile
18371: that
18372: makes
18373: them
18374: bitter—and—and
18375: barley-sugar
18376: and
18377: such
18378: things
18379: that
18380: make
18381: children
18382: sweet-tempered
18383: i
18384: only
18385: wish
18386: people
18387: knew
18388: that
18389: then
18390: they
18391: wouldn’t
18392: be
18393: so
18394: stingy
18395: about
18396: it
18397: you
18398: know
18399: she
18400: had
18401: quite
18402: forgotten
18403: the
18404: duchess
18405: by
18406: this
18407: time
18408: and
18409: was
18410: a
18411: little
18412: startled
18413: when
18414: she
18415: heard
18416: her
18417: voice
18418: close
18419: to
18420: her
18421: ear
18422: you’re
18423: thinking
18424: about
18425: something
18426: my
18427: dear
18428: and
18429: that
18430: makes
18431: you
18432: forget
18433: to
18434: talk
18435: i
18436: can’t
18437: tell
18438: you
18439: just
18440: now
18441: what
18442: the
18443: moral
18444: of
18445: that
18446: is
18447: but
18448: i
18449: shall
18450: remember
18451: it
18452: in
18453: a
18454: bit
18455: perhaps
18456: it
18457: hasn’t
18458: one
18459: alice
18460: ventured
18461: to
18462: remark
18463: tut
18464: tut
18465: child
18466: said
18467: the
18468: duchess
18469: everything’s
18470: got
18471: a
18472: moral
18473: if
18474: only
18475: you
18476: can
18477: find
18478: it
18479: and
18480: she
18481: squeezed
18482: herself
18483: up
18484: closer
18485: to
18486: alice’s
18487: side
18488: as
18489: she
18490: spoke
18491: alice
18492: did
18493: not
18494: much
18495: like
18496: keeping
18497: so
18498: close
18499: to
18500: her
18501: first
18502: because
18503: the
18504: duchess
18505: was
18506: very
18507: ugly
18508: and
18509: secondly
18510: because
18511: she
18512: was
18513: exactly
18514: the
18515: right
18516: height
18517: to
18518: rest
18519: her
18520: chin
18521: upon
18522: alice’s
18523: shoulder
18524: and
18525: it
18526: was
18527: an
18528: uncomfortably
18529: sharp
18530: chin
18531: however
18532: she
18533: did
18534: not
18535: like
18536: to
18537: be
18538: rude
18539: so
18540: she
18541: bore
18542: it
18543: as
18544: well
18545: as
18546: she
18547: could
18548: the
18549: game’s
18550: going
18551: on
18552: rather
18553: better
18554: now
18555: she
18556: said
18557: by
18558: way
18559: of
18560: keeping
18561: up
18562: the
18563: conversation
18564: a
18565: little
18566: tis
18567: so
18568: said
18569: the
18570: duchess
18571: and
18572: the

19157: frightened
19158: to
19159: say
19160: a
19161: word
19162: but
19163: slowly
19164: followed
19165: her
19166: back
19167: to
19168: the
19169: croquet-ground

19536: fun
19537: said
19538: the
19539: gryphon
19540: half
19541: to
19542: itself
19543: half
19544: to
19545: alice
19546: what

19548: the
19549: fun

19551: alice
19552: why
19553: she
19554: said
19555: the
19556: gryphon
19557: it’s
19558: all

19602: the
19603: mock
19604: turtle
19605: in
19606: the
19607: distance
19608: sitting
19609: sad
19610: and
19611: lonely
19612: on
19613: a
19614: little
19615: ledge
19616: of
19617: rock
19618: and
19619: as
19620: they
19621: came
19622: nearer
19623: alice
19624: could
19625: hear
19626: him
19627: sighing
19628: as
19629: if
19630: his
19631: heart
19632: would
19633: break
19634: she
19635: pitied
19636: him
19637: deeply
19638: what

19640: his
19641: sorrow
19642: she
19643: asked
19644: the
19645: gryphon
19646: and
19647: the
19648: gryphon
19649: answered
19650: very
19651: nearly
19652: in
19653: the
19654: same
19655: words
19656: as
19657: before
19658: it’s
19659: all
19660: his
19661: fancy
19662: that
19663: he

19675: up
19676: to
19677: the
19678: mock
19679: turtle
19680: who
19681: looked
19682: at
19683: them
19684: with
19685: large
19686: eyes
19687: full
19688: of
19689: tears
19690: but

19693: this
19694: here
19695: young
19696: lady

19716: turtle
19717: in
19718: a
19719: deep
19720: hollow
19721: tone
19722: sit
19723: down
19724: both
19725: of
19726: you
19727: and

19730: a
19731: word
19732: till
19733: i’ve
19734: finished
19735: so
19736: they
19737: sat
19738: down
19739: and
19740: nobody
19741: spoke
19742: for
19743: some
19744: minutes
19745: alice
19746: thought
19747: to
19748: herself
19749: i
19750: don’t
19751: see
19752: how
19753: he
19754: can

19757: if
19758: he
19759: doesn’t
19760: begin
19761: but
19762: she
19763: waited
19764: patiently
19765: once
19766: said
19767: the
19768: mock
19769: turtle
19770: at
19771: last
19772: with
19773: a
19774: deep
19775: sigh
19776: i
19777: was
19778: a
19779: real
19780: turtle
19781: these
19782: words
19783: were
19784: followed
19785: by
19786: a
19787: very
19788: long
19789: silence
19790: broken
19791: only
19792: by
19793: an
19794: occasional
19795: exclamation
19796: of
19797: hjckrrh
19798: from
19799: the
19800: gryphon
19801: and
19802: the
19803: constant
19804: heavy
19805: sobbing
19806: of
19807: the
19808: mock
19809: turtle
19810: alice
19811: was
19812: very
19813: nearly
19814: getting
19815: up
19816: and
19817: saying
19818: thank
19819: you
19820: sir
19821: for
19822: your
19823: interesting
19824: story
19825: but
19826: she
19827: could
19828: not
19829: help
19830: thinking
19831: there
19832: must
19833: be
19834: more
19835: to
19836: come
19837: so
19838: she
19839: sat
19840: still
19841: and
19842: said
19843: nothing
19844: when
19845: we
19846: were
19847: little
19848: the
19849: mock
19850: turtle
19851: went
19852: on
19853: at
19854: last
19855: more
19856: calmly
19857: though
19858: still
19859: sobbing
19860: a
19861: little
19862: now
19863: and
19864: then
19865: we
19866: went
19867: to
19868: school
19869: in
19870: the
19871: sea
19872: the
19873: master
19874: was
19875: an
19876: old
19877: turtle—we
19878: used
19879: to
19880: call
19881: him
19882: tortoise
19883: why
19884: did
19885: you
19886: call
19887: him
19888: tortoise
19889: if
19890: he
19891: wasn’t
19892: one
19893: alice
19894: asked
19895: we
19896: called
19897: him
19898: tortoise
19899: because
19900: he
19901: taught
19902: us
19903: said
19904: the
19905: mock
19906: turtle
19907: angrily
19908: really
19909: you
19910: are
19911: very
19912: dull
19913: you
19914: ought
19915: to
19916: be
19917: ashamed
19918: of
19919: yourself
19920: for
19921: asking
19922: such
19923: a
19924: simple
19925: question
19926: added
19927: the
19928: gryphon
19929: and
19930: then
19931: they
19932: both
19933: sat
19934: silent
19935: and
19936: looked
19937: at
19938: poor
19939: alice
19940: who
19941: felt
19942: ready
19943: to
19944: sink
19945: into
19946: the
19947: earth
19948: at
19949: last
19950: the
19951: gryphon
19952: said
19953: to
19954: the
19955: mock
19956: turtle
19957: drive
19958: on

19962: be
19963: all
19964: day
19965: about
19966: it
19967: and
19968: he
19969: went
19970: on
19971: in
19972: these
19973: words
19974: yes
19975: we
19976: went
19977: to
19978: school
19979: in
19980: the
19981: sea
19982: though
19983: you
19984: mayn’t
19985: believe
19986: it
19987: i
19988: never
19989: said
19990: i
19991: didn’t
19992: interrupted
19993: alice
19994: you
19995: did
19996: said
19997: the
19998: mock
19999: turtle
20000: hold
20001: your
20002: tongue
20003: added
20004: the
20005: gryphon
20006: before
20007: alice
20008: could
20009: speak
20010: again
20011: the
20012: mock
20013: turtle
20014: went
20015: on
20016: we
20017: had
20018: the
20019: best
20020: of
20021: educations—in
20022: fact
20023: we
20024: went
20025: to

20029: i’ve
20030: been
20031: to
20032: a
20033: day-school
20034: too
20035: said
20036: alice
20037: you
20038: needn’t
20039: be
20040: so
20041: proud

21656: use
21657: going

21688: take
21689: such
21690: a
21691: dreadful
21692: time

21696: telling
21697: them
21698: her
21699: adventures

21709: rabbit
21710: she
21711: was
21712: a
21713: little
21714: nervous
21715: about
21716: it
21717: just
21718: at
21719: first
21720: the
21721: two
21722: creatures
21723: got

21727: her
21728: one
21729: on
21730: each

21735: eyes
21736: and
21737: mouths
21738: so
21739: very
21740: wide
21741: but
21742: she
21743: gained
21744: courage
21745: as
21746: she
21747: went
21748: on
21749: her
21750: listeners
21751: were
21752: perfectly
21753: quiet
21754: till
21755: she

21757: to
21758: the
21759: part
21760: about

21770: caterpillar
21771: and
21772: the
21773: words
21774: all
21775: coming
21776: different
21777: and
21778: then
21779: the
21780: mock
21781: turtle
21782: drew
21783: a
21784: long
21785: breath
21786: and
21787: said
21788: that’s
21789: very
21790: curious
21791: it’s
21792: all
21793: about
21794: as
21795: curious
21796: as
21797: it
21798: can
21799: be

21805: came
21806: different
21807: the
21808: mock
21809: turtle

21813: should
21814: like
21815: to
21816: hear

21822: now
21823: tell
21824: her
21825: to
21826: begin
21827: he
21828: looked
21829: at
21830: the
21831: gryphon
21832: as
21833: if
21834: he
21835: thought
21836: it
21837: had
21838: some
21839: kind
21840: of
21841: authority
21842: over
21843: alice
21844: stand
21845: up
21846: and
21847: repeat
21848: tis
21849: the
21850: voice
21851: of
21852: the
21853: sluggard
21854: said
21855: the
21856: gryphon
21857: how
21858: the
21859: creatures
21860: order
21861: one
21862: about
21863: and
21864: make
21865: one
21866: repeat
21867: lessons
21868: thought
21869: alice
21870: i
21871: might
21872: as
21873: well
21874: be
21875: at
21876: school
21877: at
21878: once
21879: however
21880: she
21881: got
21882: up
21883: and
21884: began
21885: to
21886: repeat
21887: it
21888: but
21889: her
21890: head
21891: was
21892: so
21893: full
21894: of
21895: the
21896: lobster
21897: quadrille
21898: that
21899: she
21900: hardly
21901: knew
21902: what
21903: she
21904: was
21905: saying
21906: and
21907: the
21908: words
21909: came
21910: very
21911: queer
21912: indeed
21913: tis
21914: the
21915: voice
21916: of
21917: the
21918: lobster
21919: i
21920: heard
21921: him
21922: declare
21923: you
21924: have
21925: baked
21926: me
21927: too
21928: brown
21929: i
21930: must
21931: sugar
21932: my
21933: hair
21934: as
21935: a
21936: duck
21937: with
21938: its
21939: eyelids
21940: so
21941: he
21942: with
21943: his
21944: nose
21945: trims
21946: his
21947: belt
21948: and
21949: his
21950: buttons
21951: and
21952: turns
21953: out
21954: his
21955: toes
21956: later
21957: editions
21958: continued
21959: as
21960: follows
21961: when
21962: the
21963: sands
21964: are
21965: all
21966: dry
21967: he
21968: is
21969: gay
21970: as
21971: a
21972: lark
21973: and
21974: will
21975: talk
21976: in
21977: contemptuous
21978: tones
21979: of
21980: the
21981: shark
21982: but
21983: when
21984: the
21985: tide
21986: rises
21987: and
21988: sharks
21989: are
21990: around
21991: his
21992: voice
21993: has
21994: a
21995: timid
21996: and
21997: tremulous
21998: sound
21999: that’s
22000: different
22001: from
22002: what
22003: i
22004: used
22005: to
22006: say
22007: when
22008: i
22009: was
22010: a
22011: child
22012: said
22013: the
22014: gryphon
22015: well
22016: i
22017: never
22018: heard
22019: it
22020: before
22021: said
22022: the
22023: mock
22024: turtle
22025: but
22026: it
22027: sounds
22028: uncommon
22029: nonsense
22030: alice
22031: said
22032: nothing
22033: she
22034: had
22035: sat
22036: down
22037: with
22038: her
22039: face
22040: in
22041: her
22042: hands
22043: wondering
22044: if
22045: anything
22046: would
22047: ever
22048: happen
22049: in
22050: a
22051: natural
22052: way
22053: again
22054: i
22055: should
22056: like
22057: to
22058: have
22059: it
22060: explained
22061: said
22062: the
22063: mock
22064: turtle
22065: she
22066: can’t
22067: explain
22068: it
22069: said
22070: the
22071: gryphon
22072: hastily
22073: go
22074: on
22075: with
22076: the
22077: next
22078: verse
22079: but
22080: about
22081: his
22082: toes
22083: the
22084: mock
22085: turtle
22086: persisted
22087: how
22088: could
22089: he
22090: turn
22091: them
22092: out
22093: with
22094: his
22095: nose
22096: you
22097: know
22098: it’s
22099: the
22100: first
22101: position
22102: in
22103: dancing
22104: alice
22105: said
22106: but
22107: was
22108: dreadfully
22109: puzzled
22110: by
22111: the
22112: whole
22113: thing
22114: and
22115: longed
22116: to
22117: change
22118: the
22119: subject
22120: go
22121: on
22122: with
22123: the
22124: next
22125: verse
22126: the
22127: gryphon
22128: repeated
22129: impatiently
22130: it
22131: begins
22132: i
22133: passed
22134: by
22135: his
22136: garden
22137: alice
22138: did
22139: not
22140: dare
22141: to
22142: disobey
22143: though
22144: she
22145: felt
22146: sure
22147: it
22148: would
22149: all
22150: come
22151: wrong
22152: and
22153: she
22154: went
22155: on
22156: in
22157: a
22158: trembling
22159: voice
22160: i
22161: passed
22162: by
22163: his
22164: garden
22165: and
22166: marked
22167: with
22168: one
22169: eye
22170: how
22171: the
22172: owl
22173: and
22174: the
22175: panther
22176: were
22177: sharing
22178: a
22179: pie
22180: later
22181: editions
22182: continued
22183: as
22184: follows
22185: the
22186: panther
22187: took
22188: pie-crust
22189: and
22190: gravy
22191: and
22192: meat
22193: while
22194: the
22195: owl
22196: had
22197: the
22198: dish
22199: as
22200: its
22201: share
22202: of
22203: the
22204: treat
22205: when
22206: the
22207: pie
22208: was
22209: all
22210: finished
22211: the
22212: owl
22213: as
22214: a
22215: boon
22216: was
22217: kindly
22218: permitted
22219: to
22220: pocket
22221: the
22222: spoon
22223: while
22224: the
22225: panther
22226: received
22227: knife
22228: and
22229: fork
22230: with
22231: a
22232: growl
22233: and
22234: concluded
22235: the
22236: banquet
22237: what
22238: is
22239: the
22240: use
22241: of
22242: repeating
22243: all
22244: that
22245: stuff
22246: the
22247: mock
22248: turtle
22249: interrupted

22583: the

22591: with

22624: very
22625: middle

22634: large
22635: dish
22636: of
22637: tarts
22638: upon
22639: it
22640: they
22641: looked
22642: so
22643: good
22644: that
22645: it
22646: made
22647: alice
22648: quite
22649: hungry
22650: to
22651: look
22652: at
22653: them—“i
22654: wish
22655: they’d
22656: get
22657: the
22658: trial
22659: done
22660: she
22661: thought
22662: and
22663: hand
22664: round
22665: the
22666: refreshments
22667: but
22668: there
22669: seemed
22670: to
22671: be
22672: no
22673: chance
22674: of
22675: this
22676: so
22677: she
22678: began
22679: looking
22680: at
22681: everything
22682: about
22683: her
22684: to
22685: pass
22686: away
22687: the
22688: time
22689: alice
22690: had
22691: never
22692: been
22693: in
22694: a
22695: court
22696: of
22697: justice
22698: before
22699: but
22700: she
22701: had
22702: read
22703: about
22704: them
22705: in
22706: books
22707: and
22708: she
22709: was
22710: quite
22711: pleased
22712: to
22713: find
22714: that
22715: she
22716: knew
22717: the
22718: name
22719: of
22720: nearly
22721: everything
22722: there
22723: that’s
22724: the
22725: judge
22726: she
22727: said
22728: to
22729: herself
22730: because
22731: of
22732: his
22733: great
22734: wig
22735: the
22736: judge
22737: by
22738: the
22739: way
22740: was
22741: the
22742: king
22743: and
22744: as
22745: he
22746: wore
22747: his
22748: crown
22749: over
22750: the
22751: wig
22752: look
22753: at
22754: the
22755: frontispiece
22756: if
22757: you
22758: want
22759: to
22760: see
22761: how
22762: he
22763: did
22764: it
22765: he
22766: did
22767: not
22768: look
22769: at
22770: all
22771: comfortable
22772: and
22773: it
22774: was
22775: certainly
22776: not
22777: becoming
22778: and
22779: that’s
22780: the
22781: jury-box
22782: thought
22783: alice
22784: and
22785: those
22786: twelve
22787: creatures
22788: she
22789: was
22790: obliged
22791: to
22792: say
22793: creatures
22794: you
22795: see
22796: because
22797: some
22798: of
22799: them
22800: were
22801: animals
22802: and
22803: some
22804: were
22805: birds
22806: i
22807: suppose
22808: they
22809: are
22810: the
22811: jurors
22812: she
22813: said
22814: this
22815: last
22816: word
22817: two
22818: or
22819: three
22820: times
22821: over
22822: to
22823: herself
22824: being
22825: rather
22826: proud
22827: of
22828: it
22829: for
22830: she
22831: thought
22832: and
22833: rightly
22834: too
22835: that
22836: very
22837: few
22838: little
22839: girls
22840: of
22841: her
22842: age
22843: knew
22844: the
22845: meaning
22846: of
22847: it
22848: at
22849: all
22850: however
22851: jury-men
22852: would
22853: have
22854: done
22855: just
22856: as
22857: well
22858: the
22859: twelve
22860: jurors
22861: were
22862: all
22863: writing
22864: very
22865: busily
22866: on
22867: slates
22868: what
22869: are
22870: they
22871: doing
22872: alice
22873: whispered
22874: to
22875: the
22876: gryphon
22877: they
22878: can’t
22879: have
22880: anything
22881: to
22882: put
22883: down
22884: yet
22885: before
22886: the
22887: trial’s
22888: begun
22889: they’re
22890: putting
22891: down
22892: their
22893: names
22894: the
22895: gryphon
22896: whispered
22897: in
22898: reply
22899: for
22900: fear
22901: they
22902: should
22903: forget
22904: them
22905: before
22906: the
22907: end
22908: of
22909: the
22910: trial
22911: stupid
22912: things
22913: alice
22914: began
22915: in
22916: a
22917: loud
22918: indignant
22919: voice
22920: but
22921: she
22922: stopped
22923: hastily
22924: for
22925: the
22926: white
22927: rabbit
22928: cried
22929: out
22930: silence
22931: in
22932: the
22933: court
22934: and
22935: the
22936: king
22937: put
22938: on
22939: his
22940: spectacles
22941: and
22942: looked
22943: anxiously
22944: round
22945: to
22946: make
22947: out
22948: who
22949: was
22950: talking
22951: alice
22952: could
22953: see
22954: as
22955: well
22956: as
22957: if
22958: she
22959: were
22960: looking
22961: over
22962: their
22963: shoulders
22964: that

22976: and
22977: she
22978: could
22979: even
22980: make
22981: out
22982: that
22983: one
22984: of

23405: the
23406: hatter
23407: who
23408: turned

23436: the
23437: witness
23438: at
23439: all

23441: kept
23442: shifting
23443: from
23444: one
23445: foot
23446: to
23447: the
23448: other
23449: looking
23450: uneasily
23451: at
23452: the
23453: queen
23454: and
23455: in
23456: his
23457: confusion
23458: he
23459: bit
23460: a
23461: large
23462: piece
23463: out
23464: of
23465: his
23466: teacup
23467: instead
23468: of
23469: the
23470: bread-and-butter
23471: just
23472: at
23473: this
23474: moment
23475: alice
23476: felt
23477: a
23478: very
23479: curious
23480: sensation
23481: which
23482: puzzled
23483: her
23484: a
23485: good
23486: deal
23487: until
23488: she
23489: made
23490: out
23491: what
23492: it
23493: was
23494: she
23495: was
23496: beginning
23497: to
23498: grow
23499: larger
23500: again
23501: and
23502: she
23503: thought
23504: at
23505: first
23506: she
23507: would
23508: get
23509: up
23510: and
23511: leave
23512: the
23513: court
23514: but
23515: on
23516: second
23517: thoughts
23518: she
23519: decided
23520: to
23521: remain
23522: where
23523: she
23524: was
23525: as
23526: long
23527: as
23528: there
23529: was
23530: room
23531: for
23532: her
23533: i
23534: wish
23535: you
23536: wouldn’t
23537: squeeze
23538: so
23539: said
23540: the
23541: dormouse
23542: who
23543: was
23544: sitting
23545: next
23546: to
23547: her
23548: i
23549: can
23550: hardly
23551: breathe
23552: i
23553: can’t
23554: help
23555: it
23556: said
23557: alice
23558: very
23559: meekly
23560: i’m
23561: growing
23562: you’ve
23563: no
23564: right
23565: to
23566: grow
23567: here
23568: said
23569: the
23570: dormouse
23571: don’t
23572: talk
23573: nonsense
23574: said
23575: alice
23576: more
23577: boldly
23578: you
23579: know
23580: you’re
23581: growing
23582: too
23583: yes
23584: but
23585: i
23586: grow
23587: at
23588: a
23589: reasonable
23590: pace
23591: said
23592: the
23593: dormouse
23594: not
23595: in
23596: that
23597: ridiculous
23598: fashion
23599: and
23600: he
23601: got
23602: up
23603: very
23604: sulkily
23605: and
23606: crossed
23607: over
23608: to
23609: the
23610: other
23611: side
23612: of
23613: the
23614: court
23615: all
23616: this
23617: time
23618: the
23619: queen
23620: had
23621: never
23622: left
23623: off
23624: staring
23625: at
23626: the
23627: hatter
23628: and
23629: just
23630: as
23631: the
23632: dormouse
23633: crossed
23634: the
23635: court
23636: she
23637: said
23638: to
23639: one
23640: of
23641: the
23642: officers
23643: of
23644: the
23645: court
23646: bring
23647: me

23649: list

23652: singers
23653: in
23654: the
23655: last
23656: concert
23657: on
23658: which
23659: the
23660: wretched
23661: hatter
23662: trembled
23663: so
23664: that
23665: he
23666: shook
23667: both
23668: his
23669: shoes
23670: off
23671: give
23672: your
23673: evidence
23674: the
23675: king
23676: repeated
23677: angrily
23678: or
23679: i’ll
23680: have
23681: you
23682: executed
23683: whether
23684: you’re
23685: nervous
23686: or
23687: not
23688: i’m
23689: a
23690: poor
23691: man
23692: your
23693: majesty
23694: the
23695: hatter
23696: began
23697: in
23698: a
23699: trembling
23700: voice
23701: and
23702: i
23703: hadn’t
23704: begun
23705: my
23706: tea—not
23707: above
23708: a
23709: week
23710: or
23711: so—and
23712: what
23713: with
23714: the
23715: bread-and-butter
23716: getting
23717: so
23718: thin—and

24455: tipped
24456: over
24457: the
24458: jury-box
24459: with
24460: the
24461: edge
24462: of
24463: her
24464: skirt
24465: upsetting
24466: all
24467: the
24468: jurymen
24469: on
24470: to
24471: the
24472: heads
24473: of
24474: the
24475: crowd
24476: below
24477: and
24478: there
24479: they
24480: lay
24481: sprawling
24482: about
24483: reminding
24484: her
24485: very
24486: much
24487: of
24488: a
24489: globe
24490: of
24491: goldfish
24492: she
24493: had
24494: accidentally
24495: upset
24496: the
24497: week
24498: before
24499: oh
24500: i
24501: beg
24502: your
24503: pardon
24504: she
24505: exclaimed
24506: in
24507: a
24508: tone
24509: of
24510: great
24511: dismay
24512: and
24513: began
24514: picking
24515: them
24516: up
24517: again
24518: as
24519: quickly
24520: as
24521: she
24522: could
24523: for
24524: the
24525: accident
24526: of
24527: the
24528: goldfish
24529: kept
24530: running
24531: in
24532: her
24533: head
24534: and
24535: she
24536: had
24537: a
24538: vague
24539: sort
24540: of
24541: idea
24542: that
24543: they
24544: must
24545: be
24546: collected
24547: at
24548: once
24549: and
24550: put
24551: back
24552: into
24553: the
24554: jury-box
24555: or
24556: they
24557: would
24558: die
24559: the
24560: trial
24561: cannot
24562: proceed
24563: said
24564: the
24565: king
24566: in
24567: a
24568: very
24569: grave
24570: voice
24571: until
24572: all
24573: the
24574: jurymen
24575: are
24576: back
24577: in
24578: their
24579: proper
24580: places—_all
24581: he
24582: repeated
24583: with
24584: great
24585: emphasis
24586: looking
24587: hard
24588: at
24589: alice
24590: as
24591: he
24592: said
24593: so
24594: alice
24595: looked
24596: at
24597: the
24598: jury-box
24599: and
24600: saw
24601: that
24602: in
24603: her
24604: haste
24605: she
24606: had
24607: put
24608: the
24609: lizard
24610: in
24611: head
24612: downwards
24613: and
24614: the
24615: poor
24616: little
24617: thing
24618: was
24619: waving
24620: its
24621: tail
24622: about
24623: in
24624: a
24625: melancholy
24626: way
24627: being
24628: quite
24629: unable
24630: to
24631: move
24632: she
24633: soon
24634: got
24635: it
24636: out
24637: again
24638: and
24639: put
24640: it
24641: right
24642: not
24643: that
24644: it
24645: signifies
24646: much
24647: she
24648: said
24649: to
24650: herself
24651: i
24652: should
24653: think
24654: it
24655: would
24656: be
24657: quite
24658: as
24659: much
24660: use
24661: in
24662: the
24663: trial
24664: one
24665: way
24666: up
24667: as
24668: the
24669: other
24670: as
24671: soon
24672: as
24673: the
24674: jury
24675: had
24676: a
24677: little
24678: recovered
24679: from
24680: the
24681: shock
24682: of
24683: being
24684: upset
24685: and
24686: their
24687: slates
24688: and
24689: pencils
24690: had
24691: been
24692: found
24693: and
24694: handed
24695: back
24696: to
24697: them
24698: they
24699: set
24700: to
24701: work
24702: very
24703: diligently
24704: to
24705: write
24706: out
24707: a
24708: history
24709: of
24710: the
24711: accident
24712: all
24713: except
24714: the
24715: lizard
24716: who
24717: seemed
24718: too
24719: much
24720: overcome
24721: to
24722: do
24723: anything
24724: but
24725: sit
24726: with
24727: its
24728: mouth
24729: open
24730: gazing
24731: up
24732: into
24733: the
24734: roof
24735: of
24736: the
24737: court
24738: what

24740: you
24741: know
24742: about
24743: this
24744: business
24745: the
24746: king
24747: said
24748: to
24749: alice
24750: nothing
24751: said
24752: alice
24753: nothing
24754: whatever
24755: persisted
24756: the
24757: king
24758: nothing
24759: whatever
24760: said
24761: alice
24762: that’s
24763: very
24764: important
24765: the
24766: king
24767: said
24768: turning
24769: to
24770: the
24771: jury
24772: they
24773: were
24774: just
24775: beginning
24776: to
24777: write
24778: this
24779: down
24780: on
24781: their
24782: slates
24783: when
24784: the
24785: white
24786: rabbit
24787: interrupted
24788: un_important
24789: your
24790: majesty
24791: means
24792: of
24793: course
24794: he
24795: said
24796: in
24797: a
24798: very
24799: respectful
24800: tone
24801: but
24802: frowning
24803: and
24804: making
24805: faces
24806: at
24807: him
24808: as
24809: he
24810: spoke
24811: un_important
24812: of
24813: course
24814: i
24815: meant
24816: the
24817: king
24818: hastily
24819: said
24820: and
24821: went
24822: on
24823: to
24824: himself
24825: in
24826: an
24827: undertone
24828: important—unimportant—unimportant—important
24829: as
24830: if
24831: he
24832: were
24833: trying
24834: which
24835: word
24836: sounded
24837: best
24838: some
24839: of
24840: the
24841: jury
24842: wrote
24843: it
24844: down
24845: important
24846: and
24847: some
24848: unimportant
24849: alice
24850: could
24851: see
24852: this
24853: as
24854: she
24855: was
24856: near
24857: enough
24858: to
24859: look
24860: over
24861: their
24862: slates
24863: but
24864: it
24865: doesn’t
24866: matter
24867: a
24868: bit
24869: she
24870: thought
24871: to
24872: herself
24873: at
24874: this
24875: moment
24876: the
24877: king
24878: who
24879: had
24880: been
24881: for
24882: some
24883: time
24884: busily

24888: note-book
24889: cackled
24890: out

24897: book
24898: rule
24899: forty-two
24900: all

24906: high
24907: to

24926: king
24927: nearly
24928: two
24929: miles
24930: high

24937: go
24938: at
24939: any

24942: alice
24943: besides
24944: that’s
24945: not
24946: a
24947: regular
24948: rule
24949: you
24950: invented
24951: it
24952: just
24953: now
24954: it’s
24955: the
24956: oldest
24957: rule
24958: in
24959: the
24960: book
24961: said
24962: the
24963: king
24964: then
24965: it
24966: ought
24967: to
24968: be
24969: number
24970: one
24971: said
24972: alice
24973: the
24974: king
24975: turned
24976: pale
24977: and
24978: shut
24979: his
24980: note-book
24981: hastily
24982: consider
24983: your
24984: verdict
24985: he
24986: said
24987: to
24988: the
24989: jury
24990: in
24991: a
24992: low
24993: trembling
24994: voice
24995: there’s
24996: more
24997: evidence
24998: to
24999: come
25000: yet
25001: please
25002: your
25003: majesty

25009: up
25010: in
25011: a
25012: great
25013: hurry
25014: this
25015: paper
25016: has
25017: just
25018: been
25019: picked
25020: up
25021: what’s

25031: yet
25032: said
25033: the
25034: white
25035: rabbit
25036: but
25037: it
25038: seems
25039: to
25040: be
25041: a
25042: letter
25043: written
25044: by
25045: the
25046: prisoner
25047: to—to

25101: spoke
25102: and

25104: it
25105: isn’t
25106: a
25107: letter
25108: after
25109: all

25111: a
25112: set
25113: of
25114: verses

25406: as
25407: we
25408: were
25409: my

25456: the
25457: most
25458: important
25459: piece
25460: of
25461: evidence
25462: we’ve
25463: heard

25926: air
25927: and
25928: came
25929: flying
25930: down
25931: upon
25932: her
25933: she
25934: gave
25935: a
25936: little
25937: scream
25938: half
25939: of
25940: fright
25941: and
25942: half
25943: of
25944: anger
25945: and
25946: tried
25947: to
25948: beat
25949: them
25950: off
25951: and
25952: found
25953: herself
25954: lying
25955: on
25956: the
25957: bank
25958: with
25959: her
25960: head
25961: in
25962: the
25963: lap
25964: of
25965: her
25966: sister
25967: who
25968: was
25969: gently
25970: brushing
25971: away
25972: some
25973: dead
25974: leaves
25975: that
25976: had
25977: fluttered
25978: down
25979: from
25980: the
25981: trees
25982: upon
25983: her
25984: face
25985: wake
25986: up
25987: alice
25988: dear
25989: said
25990: her
25991: sister
25992: why
25993: what
25994: a
25995: long
25996: sleep
25997: you’ve
25998: had
25999: oh
26000: i’ve
26001: had
26002: such
26003: a
26004: curious
26005: dream
26006: said
26007: alice
26008: and
26009: she
26010: told
26011: her
26012: sister
26013: as
26014: well
26015: as
26016: she
26017: could
26018: remember
26019: them
26020: all
26021: these
26022: strange
26023: adventures
26024: of
26025: hers
26026: that
26027: you
26028: have
26029: just
26030: been
26031: reading
26032: about
26033: and
26034: when
26035: she
26036: had
26037: finished
26038: her
26039: sister
26040: kissed
26041: her
26042: and
26043: said
26044: it
26045: was
26046: a
26047: curious
26048: dream
26049: dear
26050: certainly
26051: but
26052: now
26053: run
26054: in
26055: to
26056: your
26057: tea
26058: it’s
26059: getting
26060: late
26061: so
26062: alice
26063: got
26064: up
26065: and
26066: ran
26067: off
26068: thinking
26069: while
26070: she
26071: ran
26072: as
26073: well
26074: she
26075: might
26076: what
26077: a
26078: wonderful
26079: dream
26080: it
26081: had
26082: been
26083: but
26084: her
26085: sister
26086: sat
26087: still
26088: just
26089: as
26090: she
26091: left
26092: her
26093: leaning
26094: her
26095: head
26096: on
26097: her
26098: hand
26099: watching
26100: the
26101: setting
26102: sun
26103: and
26104: thinking
26105: of
26106: little
26107: alice
26108: and
26109: all
26110: her
26111: wonderful
26112: adventures
26113: till
26114: she
26115: too
26116: began
26117: dreaming
26118: after
26119: a
26120: fashion
26121: and
26122: this
26123: was
26124: her
26125: dream
26126: first
26127: she
26128: dreamed
26129: of
26130: little
26131: alice
26132: herself
26133: and
26134: once
26135: again
26136: the
26137: tiny
26138: hands
26139: were
26140: clasped
26141: upon
26142: her
26143: knee
26144: and
26145: the
26146: bright
26147: eager
26148: eyes
26149: were
26150: looking
26151: up
26152: into
26153: hers—she
26154: could
26155: hear
26156: the
26157: very
26158: tones
26159: of
26160: her
26161: voice
26162: and
26163: see
26164: that
26165: queer
26166: little
26167: toss
26168: of
26169: her
26170: head
26171: to
26172: keep
26173: back
26174: the
26175: wandering
26176: hair
26177: that
26178: would
26179: always
26180: get
26181: into
26182: her
26183: eyes—and
26184: still
26185: as
26186: she
26187: listened
26188: or
26189: seemed
26190: to
26191: listen
26192: the
26193: whole
26194: place
26195: around
26196: her
26197: became
26198: alive
26199: with
26200: the
26201: strange
26202: creatures
26203: of
26204: her
26205: little
26206: sister’s
26207: dream
26208: the
26209: long
26210: grass
26211: rustled
26212: at
26213: her
26214: feet
26215: as
26216: the
26217: white
26218: rabbit
26219: hurried
26220: by—the
26221: frightened
26222: mouse
26223: splashed
26224: his
26225: way
26226: through
26227: the
26228: neighbouring
26229: pool—she
26230: could
26231: hear
26232: the
26233: rattle
26234: of
26235: the
26236: teacups
26237: as
26238: the
26239: march
26240: hare
26241: and
26242: his
26243: friends
26244: shared
26245: their
26246: never-ending
26247: meal
26248: and
26249: the
26250: shrill
26251: voice
26252: of
26253: the
26254: queen
26255: ordering
26256: off
26257: her
26258: unfortunate
26259: guests
26260: to
26261: execution—once
26262: more
26263: the
26264: pig-baby
26265: was
26266: sneezing
26267: on
26268: the
26269: duchess’s
26270: knee
26271: while
26272: plates
26273: and
26274: dishes
26275: crashed
26276: around
26277: it—once
26278: more
26279: the
26280: shriek
26281: of
26282: the
26283: gryphon
26284: the
26285: squeaking
26286: of
26287: the
26288: lizard’s
26289: slate-pencil
26290: and
26291: the
26292: choking
26293: of
26294: the
26295: suppressed
26296: guinea-pigs
26297: filled
26298: the
26299: air
26300: mixed
26301: up
26302: with
26303: the
26304: distant
26305: sobs
26306: of
26307: the
26308: miserable
26309: mock
26310: turtle
26311: so
26312: she
26313: sat
26314: on
26315: with
26316: closed
26317: eyes
26318: and
26319: half
26320: believed
26321: herself
26322: in
26323: wonderland
26324: though
26325: she
26326: knew
26327: she
26328: had
26329: but
26330: to
26331: open
26332: them
26333: again
26334: and
26335: all
26336: would
26337: change
26338: to
26339: dull
26340: reality—the
26341: grass
26342: would
26343: be
26344: only
26345: rustling
26346: in
26347: the
26348: wind
26349: and
26350: the
26351: pool
26352: rippling
26353: to
26354: the
26355: waving
26356: of
26357: the
26358: reeds—the
26359: rattling
26360: teacups
26361: would
26362: change
26363: to
26364: tinkling
26365: sheep-bells
26366: and
26367: the
26368: queen’s
26369: shrill
26370: cries
26371: to
26372: the
26373: voice
26374: of
26375: the
26376: shepherd
26377: boy—and
26378: the
26379: sneeze
26380: of
26381: the
26382: baby
26383: the
26384: shriek
26385: of
26386: the
26387: gryphon
26388: and
26389: all
26390: the
26391: other
26392: queer
26393: noises
26394: would
26395: change
26396: she
26397: knew
26398: to
26399: the
26400: confused
26401: clamour
26402: of
26403: the
26404: busy
26405: farm-yard—while
26406: the
26407: lowing
26408: of
26409: the
26410: cattle
26411: in
26412: the
26413: distance
26414: would
26415: take
26416: the
26417: place
26418: of
26419: the
26420: mock
26421: turtle’s
26422: heavy
26423: sobs
26424: lastly
26425: she
26426: pictured
26427: to
26428: herself
26429: how
26430: this
26431: same
26432: little
26433: sister
26434: of
26435: hers
26436: would
26437: in
26438: the
26439: after-time
26440: be
26441: herself
26442: a
26443: grown
26444: woman
26445: and
26446: how
26447: she
26448: would
26449: keep
26450: through
26451: all
26452: her
26453: riper
26454: years
26455: the
26456: simple
26457: and
26458: loving
26459: heart
26460: of
26461: her
26462: childhood
26463: and
26464: how
26465: she
26466: would
26467: gather
26468: about
26469: her
26470: other
26471: little
26472: children
26473: and
26474: make
26475: their
26476: eyes
26477: bright
26478: and
26479: eager
26480: with
26481: many
26482: a
26483: strange
26484: tale
26485: perhaps
26486: even
26487: with
26488: the
26489: dream
26490: of
26491: wonderland
26492: of
26493: long
26494: ago
26495: and
26496: how
26497: she
26498: would
26499: feel
26500: with
26501: all
26502: their
26503: simple
26504: sorrows
26505: and
26506: find
26507: a
26508: pleasure
26509: in
26510: all
26511: their
26512: simple
26513: joys
26514: remembering
26515: her
26516: own
26517: child-life
26518: and
26519: the
26520: happy
26521: summer
26522: days
26523: the
26524: end
